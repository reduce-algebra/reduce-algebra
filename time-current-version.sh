#! /bin/bash

# This builds Reduec from the most up to date subversion revision
# and runs the test scripts. It puts a copy of the output from the
# testing in a file "red-REVISION:DATE.log"
#
# If invoked with an argument "profile" it will re-profile the CSL
# version of Reduce before collecting the timings.
# If given "fetch" it will bring the current sources into step with the
# sourceforge repository before doing anything. Even though I generally want
# to measure a sourcefore version I make the default behaviour without
# "fetch" be to avoid overwriting current local changes.
# "nopsl" is for use on platforms where the PSL version is not available.
#
# The above options can be given in any order and with or without prefixed
# "-" or "--". In fact the decoding is very crude indeed so any argument with
# those strings of letters included will be acted upon.
#
# HOWEVER in ALL cases this will remove and rebuild the cslbuild and
# pslbuild directories.
