\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The package {\sc Crack} attempts the solution of an overdetermined
system of algebraic, ordinary or partial differential equations
(ODEs/PDEs) with at most polynomial nonlinearities.

Under `normal circumstances' differential equations (DEs) which
describe physical processes are not overdetermined, i.e.\ the number
of DEs matches the number of unknown functions which are involved.
Although {\sc Crack} may be successful in such cases (e.g.\ for
characteristic ODE-systems of first order PDEs) this is not the
typical application. It is rather the qualitative investigations of
such differential equations, i.e.\ the investigation of their
infinitesimal symmetries (with {\sc LiePDE,ApplySym}) and conservation
laws (with {\sc Conlaw}) which result in over-determined systems which
are the main application area of {\sc Crack}.

\subsection{Interactivity}
The package was originally developed to run automatically and effort
was taken for the program to decide which computational steps are to
be done next with a choice among integrations, separations,
substitutions and investigation of integrability conditions. It is
known from hand computations that the right sequence of operations
with exactly the right equations at the right time is often crucial to
avoid an explosion of the length of expressions. This statement keeps
its truth for the computerized solution of systems of equations as
they become more complex. As a consequence more and more interactive
access has been provided to inspect data, to specify how to proceed
with the computation and how to control it. This allows the human
intervention in critical stages of the computations (see the switch
{\em off batch\_mode} below).

\subsection{General Structure}
A problem consists of a system of equations
and a set of inequalities. With each equation are associated a short
name and numerous data, like size, which functions, derivatives and
variables occur but also which investigations have already been done
with this equation and which not in order to avoid unnecessary
duplication of work.  These data are constantly updated if the
equation is modified in any way.

A set of about 30 modules is available to integrate, substitute,
decouple, ... equations. A complete list can be inspected in
interactive mode with the command {\em p2}, each operation is listed
with the number it is called. All modules can be called
interactively or automatically. Automatic computation is organized
by a priority list of modules (each represented by a number) where
modules are invoked in the order they appear in the priority list,
each module trying to find equations in the system it can be applied
to. The priority list can be inspected with the command {\em p1}.
If a module is not successful then the next module in the list
is tried, if any one is successful then execution starts again at
the beginning of the priority list.
\{\link{prog\_list\_, default\_proc\_list\_, full\_proc\_list\_}{lb1} \}

Because each module has access to all the data, it is enough to call
a module by its number. For example, the input of the number 2 in
interactive mode will start the direct separation module (see below)
to look for a directly separable equation and will split it.

\section{Syntax}
\subsection{The call}
{\sc Crack} is called by
\begin{tabbing}
  {\tt crack}(\=\{{\it equ}$_1$, {\it equ}$_2$, \ldots , {\it equ}$_m$\}, \\
              \>\{{\it ineq}$_1$, {\it ineq}$_2$, \ldots , {\it ineq}$_n$\}, \\
              \>\{{\it fun}$_1$, {\it fun}$_2$, \ldots , {\it fun}$_p$\}, \\
              \>\{{\it var}$_1$, {\it var}$_2$, \ldots , {\it var}$_q$\});
\end{tabbing}
        $m,n,p,q$ are arbitrary.
\begin{itemize}
\item
The {\it equ}$_i$ are identically vanishing partial differential expressions,
i.e.\
they represent equations  $0 = {\it equ}_i$, which are to be solved for the
functions ${\it fun}_j$ as far as possible, thereby drawing only necessary
conclusions and not restricting the general solution.
\item
The {\it ineq}$_i$ are algebraic or differential expressions which must
not vanish identically for
any solution to be determined, i.e. only such solutions are computed for which
none of the expressions {\it ineq}$_i$ vanishes identically in all independent
variables.
\item
The dependence of the (scalar) functions ${\it fun}_j$ on independent
variables must be defined beforehand with {\tt DEPEND} rather than
declaring these functions
as operators. Their arguments may  themselves only be identifiers
representing variables, not expressions.
Also other unknown functions not in ${\it fun}_j$ must not be represented
as operators but only using {\tt DEPEND}.
\item
The functions ${\it fun}_j$ and their derivatives may only occur polynomially.
\item
The ${\it var}_k$ are further independent variables, which are not
already arguments
of any of the ${\it fun}_j$. If there are none then the fourth argument is
the empty list \{\}, although it does no harm to include arguments of
functions ${\it fun}_j$.
\item
The dependence of the ${\it equ}_i$ on the independent variables and on
constants and functions other than ${\it fun}_j$ is arbitrary.
\item
{\sc Crack} can be run in automatic batch mode (by default) or
interactively with the switch {\tt OFF BATCH\_MODE}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The result}
The result is a list of solutions
\[      \{{\it sol}_1, \ldots \}  \]
where each solution is a list of 4 lists:
\begin{tabbing}
    \{\=\{${\it con}_1, \; {\it con}_2, \ldots , \; {\it con}_q$\}, \\
      \>\{${\it fun}_a={\it ex}_a, \;\;
{\it fun}_b={\it ex}_b, \ldots , \;\; {\it fun}_p={\it ex}_p$\},\=  \\
      \>\{${\it fun}_c, \;\; {\it fun}_d, \ldots , \;\; {\it fun}_r$\}, \> \\
      \>\{{\it ineq}$_1$, {\it ineq}$_2$, \ldots , {\it ineq}$_s$\}\}
\end{tabbing}
For example, in the case of a linear system, the input consists of at
most one solution ${\it sol}_1$.

If {\sc Crack} finds a contradiction as e.g. $0=1$ then there exists no
solution and it returns the empty list \{\}. If {\sc Crack}
can factorize algebraically a non-linear equation then factors are set
to zero individually and different sub-cases are studied by
{\sc Crack} calling itself recursively.
If during such a recursive call a contradiction results,
then this sub-case will not have a solution but other sub-cases still
may have solutions.
The empty list is also returned if no solution exists
which satisfies the inequalities
{\it ineq}$_i \neq 0.$

The expressions ${\it con}_i$ (if there are any), are the
remaining necessary and sufficient conditions for the functions
${\it fun}_c,\ldots,{\it fun}_r$ in the third list. Those
functions can be original functions from the equations to be
solved (of the second argument of the call of {\sc Crack}) or new
functions or constants which arose from integrations.
The dependence of new functions on variables is declared with {\tt DEPEND}
and to visualize this dependence the algebraic mode function
${\tt FARGS({\it fun}_i)}$ can be used.
If there are no ${\it con}_i$ then all equations are solved and the
functions in the third list are unconstrained.
The second list contains
equations ${\it fun}_i={\it ex}_i$ where each ${\it fun}_i$ is an
original function and ${\it ex}_i$ is the computed expression
for ${\it fun}_i$.
The elements of the fourth
list are the expressions who have been assumed to be unequal zero
in the derivation of this solution.

\subsection{Automatic vs.\ interactive}
Under normal circumstances one will try to have problems solved
automatically by {\sc Crack}. An alternative is to input
{\tt OFF BATCH\_MODE;} before calling {\sc Crack} and to solve problems
interactively. In interactive mode it is possible to
\begin{itemize}
\item inspect data, like equations and their properties, unknown
functions, variables, identities, a statistics,
\item save, change, add or drop equations,
\item add inequalities,
\item inspect and change flags and parameters which govern individual
modules as well as their interplay,
\item pick a list of methods to be used out of about 30 different
ones, and specify their priorities and in this way very easily
compose an automatic solving strategy,
\item or, for more interactive work, to specify how to proceed, i.e.\
which computational step to do and how often, like doing
 \begin{description}
 \item one automatic step,
 \item one specific step,
 \item a number of automatic steps,
 \item a specific step as often as possible or a specified number of times.
 \end{description}
\end{itemize}
To get interactive help one enters {\tt h} or {\tt ?}.

Flags and parameters are stored as symbolic fluid variables
which means that they can be accessed by {\tt lisp( ... )},
like {\tt lisp( print\_:=5 );} before calling {\sc Crack}.
{\tt print\_}, for example, is a measure of the maximal
length of expressions to be printed on the screen
(the number of factors in terms).
A complete list of flags and parameters is given at the beginning of
the file {\tt crinit.red}.

One more parameter shall be mentioned, which is the list of modules/procedures
called {\tt proc\_list\_}. In interactive mode this list can be looked
at with {\tt `p'} or be changed with {\tt `cp'}. This list defines
in which order the different modules/procedures are tried whenever
{\sc Crack} has to decide of what to do next. Exceptions
to this rule may be specified. For example, some procedure, say
$P_1$, requires after its execution another
specific procedure, say $P_2$, to be executed, no  matter whether
$P_2$ is next according to {\tt proc\_list\_} or not. This is managed by $P_1$
writing a task for procedure $P_2$ into a hot-list. Tasks listed in
the global variable {\tt `to\_do\_list'} are
dealt with in the {\tt `to\_do'} step which should
always come first in {\tt proc\_list\_}.
A way to have the convenience of running {\sc Crack} automatically
and still being able to break the fixed rhythm prescribed by {\tt
proc\_list\_} is to have the entry {\tt stop\_batch} in {\tt proc\_list\_}
and have {\sc Crack} started in automatic batch mode. Then execution
is continuing
until none of the procedures which come before {\tt stop\_batch} are
applicable any more so that {\tt stop\_batch} is executed next which will
stop automatic execution and go into interactive mode. This allows
either to continue the computation interactively, or to change the
{\tt proc\_list\_} with {\tt `cp'} and to continue in automatic mode.

The default value of {\tt proc\_list\_} does not include all possible
modules because not all are suitable for any kind of overdetermined
system to be solved. The complete list is shown in interactive mode
under {\tt `cp'}. A few basic modules are described in the following
section. The efficiency of {\sc Crack} in automatic mode is very much
depending on the content of {\tt proc\_list\_} and the sequence of its
elements. Optimizing {\tt proc\_list\_} for a given task needs
experience which can not be formalized in a few simple rules and will
therefore not be explained in more detail here. The following remarks
are only guidelines.

\section{Modules}
 The following modules are represented by numbers in
 the priority list. Each module can appear with modifications under
 different numbers. For example, integration is available under
 \link{{\em 7}}{m_7}, \link{{\em 24}}{m_24} and
 \link{{\em 25}}{m_25}.  Here \link{{\em 7}}{m_7} encodes an
 integrations of short equations
 $0=\partial^n f/\partial x^n$. \link{{\em 7}}{m_7}
 has highest priority of the three
 integrations. \link{{\em 24}}{m_24} encodes the
 integration of an equation that leads
 to the substitution of a function and \link{{\em 25}}{m_25} refers
 to any integration and has lowest priority.

\subsection{Integration and Separation}
    An early feature in the development of the package {\sc Crack}
    was the ability to integrate exact differential equations and
    some generalizations of them (see \cite{Wol99e}). As a consequence
    of integrations \link{{\em 7}}{m_7}, \link{{\em 24}}{m_24},
    \link{{\em 25}}{m_25}
    an increasing number of functions of fewer
    variables is introduced which sooner or later produces equations with some
    independent variables occuring only explicitly and not as
    variables in functions. Such equations are splitted by the
    separation module \link{{\em 2}}{m_2}. Another possibility are
    equations in which each independent variable occurs in at least
    one function in the equation but no function depends on all variables.
    In this case so-called indirect separations are appropriate:
    for linear problems \link{{\em 10}}{m_10} \link{{\em 26}}{m_26} and for
    non-linear problems \link{{\em 48}}{m_48}.

\subsection{Substitutions}
    Substitutions can have a dramatic effect on the size and
    complexity of systems. Therefore it is possible to have them not
    only done automatically but also controlled tightly,
    either by specifying exactly what equation should be used to substitute
    which unknown and where, or by picking a substitution out of a list
    of substitutions offered by the program {\em \{cs\} }. Substitutions to be
    performed automatically can be controlled with a number of filters,
    for example, by
    \begin{itemize}
    \item limiting the size of the equation to be used for
    substitution, {\em \{length\_limit\} }
    \item limiting the size of equations in which the
    substitution is to be done, {\em \{target\_limit\_\} }
    \item allowing only linear equations to
    be used for substitutions, {\em \{lin\_subst\} }
    \item allowing equations to increase in size only up
    to some factor in order for a substitution to be performed
    in that equation, {\em \{cost\_limit\} }
    \item allowing a substitution for a function through an expression
    only if that expression involves exclusively functions of fewer
    variables, {\em \{less\_vars\} }
    \item allowing substitutions only that do not lead to a case distinction
    coefficient = 0 or not,
    \item specifying whether extra effort should be spent to identify the
    substitution with the lowest bound on growth of the full system.
    {\em \{min\_growth\} }
    % parameter in make\_subst,=t for example in subst\_level\_45
    \end{itemize}
    Substitution types are represented by different numbers
    \link{(3-6,15-21)}{m_3} depending on the subset of the above
    filters to be used.  If a substitution type is to be done
    automatically then from all possible substitutions passing all
    filters of this type that substitution is selected that leads to
    no sub-cases (if available) and that uses the shortest equation.

\subsection{Factorization}
    It is very common that big algebraic systems contain equations that
    can be factorized. Factorizing an equation and setting the factors
    individually to zero simplifies the whole task because factors are
    simpler expressions than the whole equation and setting them to zero
    they may lead to substitutions and thereby further simplifications. The
    downside is that if problems with, say 100 unknowns, would need 40
    case-distinctions in order to be able to solve automatically for the
    remaining 60 unknowns then this would require $2^{40}$ cases to be
    investigated which is impractical. The problem is to find the right
    balance, between delaying case-distinctions in order not to generate
    too many cases and on the other hand introducing case distinctions
    as early as necessary in order to simplify the system. This
    simplification may be necessary to solve the system but in any
    case it will speed up its solution (although at the price of having
    to solve a simplified system at least twice, depending on the number
    of factors).

    For large systems with many factorizable equations the careful
    selection of the next equation to be factorized is important to
    gain the most from each factorization and to succeed with as few
    as possible factorizations.  Criteria which give factors and
    therefore equations a higher priority are
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the number of equations in which this factor occurs,
    \item if the factor is a single unknown function or constant,
      then the number of times this
      unknown turns up in the whole system,
    \item the total degree of the factor,
    \item the number of factors of an equation,
    \item and others.
    \end{itemize}
    It also matters in which order the factors are set to zero. For
    example, the equation  $0=ab$ can be used to split into the 2
    cases: $1.\ a=0, \ 2.\ a\neq 0, b=0$ or to split into the 2 cases
    $1.\ b=0, \ 2.\ b\neq 0, a=0$. If one of the 2 factors, say $b$, involves
    functions which occur only linearly then this property is to be
    preserved and these functions should be substituted as such
    substitutions preserve their linearity. But to have many such
    substitutions available, it is useful to know of many non-linearly
    occuring functions to be non-zero as they occur as coefficients of
    the linearly occuring functions. In the above situation it is
    therefore better to do the first splitting $1.\ a=0, \ 2.\ a\neq 0, b=0$
    because $a\neq 0$ will be more useful for substitutions of linear
    functions than $b\neq 0$ would be.

    An exception of this plausible
    rule occurs towards the end of all the substitutions of all the
    linearly occuring $b_i$ when some $b_i$ are an overall factor to
    many equations. If one would then set, say, $b_{22}=0$ as the second
    case in a factorization, the first case would generate as subcases
    factorizations of other equations where $b_{22}=0$ would be the second case
    again and so on. To avoid this one should investigate $b_{22}=0$ as the
    first case in the first factorization.

    The only purpose of that little thought experiment was to show
    that simple questions, like 'Which factored equation should
    be used first for case-distinctions and in which order to set factors to
    zero?' can already be difficult to answer in general.

    {\sc Crack} currently offers two factorization steps:
    \link{(8)}{m_8} and \link{(47)}{m_47}.

\subsection{Elimination (Gr\"{o}bner Basis) Steps}
    To increase safety and avoid excessive expression swell
    one can apart from the normal call \link{(30)}{m_30}
    request to do Gr\"{o}bner basis computation
    steps only if they are simplification steps replacing an equation by
    a shorter equation. \link{(27)}{m_27}

    In a different version only steps are performed in which equations
    are included which do not contain more than 3 unknowns. This helps
    to focus on steps which are more likely to solve small sub-systems
    with readily available simple results. \link{(57)}{m_57}

    Often the computationally cheapest way to obtain a consistent
    (involutive) system of equations implies to change the ordering
    during the computation. This is the case when substitutions
    of functions are performed which are not ranked highest in
    a lexicographical ordering of functions. But {\sc Crack} also
    offers an interactive way to
    \begin{itemize}
    \item change the lexicographical ordering of variables, {\em \{ov\} }
    \item change the lexicographical ordering of functions, {\em \{of\} }
    \item give the differential order of derivatives a higher or lower
      priority in the total ordering than the lexicographical ordering
      of functions, {\em \{og\} }
    \item give either the total differential order of a partial derivative
      a higher priority than the lexicographical ordering of
      the derivative of that function or to take the lexicographical
      ordering of derivatives as the only criterium. {\em \{of\} }
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution of an under-determined differential equation}
    When solving an over-determined system of linear differential
    equations where the general solution involves free functions, then
    in the last computational step often a single equation for more
    than one function remains to be solved. Examples are the computation
    of symmetries and conservation laws of non-linear differential
    equations which are linearizable. In {\sc Crack} two procedures are
    available, one for under-determined linear ODEs \link{(22)}{m_22}
    and one for linear PDEs, \link{(23)}{m_23}
    both with non-constant coefficients.

\subsection{Indirect Separation}
    Integrations introduce new functions of fewer variables.
    As equations are used to substitute functions of all variables
    it is only a question of time that equations are generated
    in which no function depends on all variables. If at least one variable
    occurs only explicitly then the equation can be splitted which we call
    direct separation. But sometimes all variables appear as
    variables to unknown functions, e.g.\ $0=f(x)+g(y)$ although
    usually much more complicated with 10 or 20 independent variables
    and many functions that are depending on different combinations of these
    variables. Because no variable occurs only explicitly, direct
    separations mentioned above are not possible.
    Two different algorithms, one for linear indirectly separable
    equations \link{(10)}{m_10}, \link{(26)}{m_26}
    and one for non-linear directly separable equations \link{(48)}{m_48}
    provide systematic ways of dealing with such equations.

    Indirectly separable equations always result when an equation is
    integrated with respect to different variables, like $0=f_{xy}$ to
    $f=g(x)+h(y)$ and a function, here $f(x,y)$, is substituted.

\subsection{Function and variable transformations}
    In the interactive mode one can specify a transformation of the whole
    problem with {\em pt} in which old functions and variables are expressed in a mix
    of new functions and variables.

\subsection{Solution of first order linear PDE}
    If a system contains a single linear first order PDE for just one
    function then in an automatic step characteristic ODE-systems are
    generated, integrated if possible, a variable transformation
    for the whole system of equations is performed to have in the
    first order PDE only one single derivative and to make this PDE
    integrable for the integration modules. \link{(39)}{m_39}

\subsection{Length Reduction of Equations}
    An algorithm designed originally to length-reduce differential
    equations proved to be essential in length reducing systems of
    bi-linear algebraic equations or homogeneous equations which resulted
    from bi-linear equations during the solution process.

    The aim of the method \link{(11)}{m_11}
    is to find out whether one equation $0=E_1$ can
    length reduce another one $0=E_2$ by replacing $E_2$ through an
    appropriate linear combination $\alpha E_1 - \beta E_2,\ \ \beta \neq
    0$. To find $\alpha, \beta$ one can divide each term of $E_2$ through
    each term of $E_1$ and count how often each quotient occurs.  If a
    quotient $\alpha/\beta$ occurs $m$ times then $\alpha E_1 - \beta E_2$
    will have $\leq n_1+n_2-2m$ terms because $2m$ terms will cancel each
    other. A length reduction is found if
    $n_1+n_2-2m\leq \ \mbox{max}(n_1,n_2)$.
    The method becomes efficient after a few algorithmic refinements discussed
    in \cite{Wol99b}. Length reduced equations
    \begin{itemize}
    \item are more likely to length reduce other equations,
    \item are much more likely to be factorizable,
    \item are more suited for substitutions as the substitution
      induces less growth of the whole systems and introduces fewer new
      occurences of functions in equations,
    \item are more likely to be integrable by being exact or being an ODE
      if the system consists of differential equations,
    \item involve on average fewer unknowns and make the whole system more
      sparse. This sparseness can be used to plan better a sequence of
      eliminations.
    \end{itemize}

  This concludes the listing of modules. Other aspects of {\sc Crack} follow.

\section{Features}

\subsection{Flexible Process Control}
  Different types of over-determined systems are more or less suited
  for an automatic solution. With the currrent version (2002)
  it is relatively save to try solving large bi-linear algebraic problems
  automatically. Another well suited area concerns over-determined systems
  of linear PDEs. In contrast, non-linear systems of PDEs most likely
  require a more tight interactive control. Different modes of
  operation are possible. One can
  \begin{itemize}
  \item perform one {\em\{a\}} or more computational steps {\em\{g\}}
    automatically, where each step is trying modules in the order defined by the
    current priority list {\em \{p1\} } until one module succeeds in
    its purpose,
  \item
    perform one module a specific number of times or as long as it is
    successful, {\em \{l\} }
  \item
    set a time limit until which the program should run automatically,
    {\em \{time\_limit, limit\_time\} }
  \item
    interrupt an on-going automatic computation and continue the
    computation interactively by copying the file
    {\tt \_stop\_crack} into the directory where the ongoing
    computation was started and re-naming it {\tt \_stop\_}
    (and by deleting {\tt \_stop\_} to resume automatic computation),
  \item
    arrange the priority list of modules changes
    at a certain point in the computation when the system of equations
    has changed its character,
  \item
    induce a case distinction whether a user-given expression
    is zero or not, {\em \{44\} }
  \item
    have a module that changes the priority list {\em proc\_list\_}
    dynamically, depending essentially on the size and difficulty
    of the system but also on the success rate of previous steps.
    {\em \{61, 62, 63\} }
  \end{itemize}
  Apart from flexible control over what kind of steps to be done, the
  steps themselves can be controlled more or less too, e.g.\ whether
  equations are selected by the module or the user.

  Highest priority in the priority list have so-called {\em to-do}
  steps. The list of to-do steps is usually empty but can be filled by
  any successful step if it requires another specific step to follow
  instantly. For example, if a very simple equation $0=f_x$ is
  integrated then the substitution of $f$ should follow straight away, even
  if substitutions would have a low priority according to the
  current priority list.

\subsection{Total Data Control}
  To make wise decisions of how to continue
  the computation in an interactive session one needs tools to inspect large systems of
  equations.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item equations, inequalities, functions and variables, {\em \{e, pi, f\} }
  \item the occurence of all derivatives of selected functions in any
    equation, {\em \{v\} }
  \item a statistics summary of the equations of the system, {\em \{s\} }
  \item a matrix display of occurences of unknowns in all equations, {\em \{pd\} }
  \item the value of any LISP variable, {\em \{pv\} }
  \item the value of algebraic expressions that can be specified using
        equation names \\
        (e.g.\ {\tt coeffn(e\_5,df(f,x,y),2)}), {\em \{pe\} }
  \item not under-determined subsystems. {\em \{ss\} }
  \end{itemize}

  Inspecting a computation which already goes on for hours or a day and
  that has performed many thousand steps is time consuming. The task is made
  easier with the possibility to plot graphically as a function of
  time: the type of steps performed, the number of unknowns,
  the number of remainig equations, the number of terms in these
  equations and the memory usage. {\em \{ps\} }

  When non-linear systems are considered and many case distinctions
  and sub-(sub-...)case distinctions are made in a long computation
  then one easily loses track. With one command one can
  list all cases that have been considered so far with their assumption, the number
  of steps made until they are solved or until the next sub-case distinction
  was made and the number of solutions contained in each completed
  case. {\em \{ls\} }

\subsection{Safety}
  When working on large problems it may come to a stage where computational
  steps are necessary, like substitution, which are risky in the sense
  that they may simplify the problem but also complicate it by
  increasing its size. To avoid this risk a few safety features have
  been implemented.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item At any time during the computation one can save a backup of
    the complete current situation in a file and also load a backup.
    The command {\tt sb "file\_name"} saves all global variables and
    data into an ASCII file and the command {\tt rb "file\_name"} reads
    these data from a file. The format is independent of the computer
    used and independent of the underlying {\sc Lisp} version.
    Apart from reading in a backup file during an interactive
    computation with {\em rb} one also can start a computation with
    a backup file. After loading {\sc Crack} one makes in {\sc Reduce}
    the call \verb+ CRACKSHELL()$ + %$
    followed by the file name of the backup.
  \item All key strokes are automatically recorded in a list which is
    available after each interactive step with {\em ph}, or when the
    computation has finished through {\tt lisp reverse history\_;}.
    This list can be fed into {\sc Crack} at the beginning
    of a new computation so that the same operations are performed
    automatically that were performed interactively before. The
    purpose is to be able to do an interactive exploration first and
    to repeat it afterwards automatically without having to note with
    pen or pencil all steps that had been done.

    By assigning this list to the {\sc Lisp} variable {\tt old\_history}
    before calling {\tt Crack} with {\tt off batch\_mode} the same steps
    as in the previous run are performed
    first as {\sc Crack} is first reading input from {\tt old\_history}
    and only if that is {\tt nil} then read from the keyboard.
  \item During an automatic computation the program might start a
    computational step which turns out to take far too long. It would
    be better to stop this computation and try something else instead.
    But in computer algebra with lots of global variables involved it
    is not straight forward to stop a computation in the middle of it.
    If one would use time as a criterion then it could happen that
    time is up during a garbage collection which to stop would
    be deadly for the session. {\sc Crack} allows to
    set a limit of garbage collections for any one of those
    computations that have the potential to last forever, like
    algebraic factorizations of large expressions.
    With such an arrangement an automatic computation
    can not get stuck anymore due to lengthy factorizations, searches
    for length reductions or elimination steps.
    {\em \{max\_gc\_elimin, max\_gc\_fac, max\_gc\_red\_len,
    max\_gc\_short, max\_gc\_ss\} }
  \item Due to a recent (April 2002) initiative of Winfried Neun the
    parallel version of the computer algebra system REDUCE has been
    re-activated and is running on the Beowulf cluster at Brock
    University \cite{MelNeun}. This allows conveniently (with {\em
    \{pp\} }) to duplicate the current status of a {\sc Crack}
    computation to another computer, to try out there different
    operations (e.g.\ risky ones) until a viable way to continue the
    computation is found without endangering the original session.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Managing Solutions}
  Non-linear problems can have many solutions. The number of solutions
  found by {\sc Crack} can even be higher because to make progress
  {\sc Crack} may have factorized an equation and considered the two
  cases $a=0$ and $a \neq 0$ whereas solutions in both cases could be
  merged to only one solution without any restriction for $a$. This merging
  of solutions can be accomplished with a separate program {\tt
  merge\_sol()} after the computation.

  Another form of post-processing is the production of
  a web page for each solution, like
  \special{html:<a href="http://lie.math.brocku.ca/twolf/bl/v/v1l05o35-s1.html">}
           http://lie.math.brocku.ca/twolf/bl/v/v1l05o35-s1.html
  \special{html:</a>}
%  \verb+http://lie.math.brocku.ca/twolf/bl/v1l05o35-s1.html+ .

  If in the solution of over-determined differential equations the
  program performs integrations of equations before the differential
  Gr\"{o}bner basis was computed then in the final solution there may
  be redundant constants or functions of integration.
  Redundant constants or functions in a solution are not an
  error but they make solutions appear unnecessarily complicated.
  In a postprocessing step these functions and constants can be eliminated.
  {\em \{adjust\_fnc, drop\_const(), dropredundant()\} }

\subsection{Parallelization}
  The availability of a parallel version of {\sc Crack} was mentioned
  above allowing to try out different ways to continue an ongoing
  computation. A different possibility to make use of a cluster of
  computers with {\sc Crack} is, to export automatically the
  investigation of sub-cases and sub-sub-cases to different computers
  to be solved in parallel.

  It was explained above how factorizations may be necessary to make
  any progress but also their potential of exploding the time requirements.
  By running the computation on a cluster and
  being able to solve many more cases one can give factorizations a
  higher priority and capitalize on the benefit of factorizations,
  i.e.\ the simplification of the problem.

\subsection{Relationship to Gr\"{o}bner Basis Algorithms}
  For systems of equations in which the unknown constants or functions
  turn up only polynomially a well known method is able to check the
  consistency of the system. For algebraic systems this is the
  Gr\"{o}bner Basis Method and for systems of differential equations
  this is the differential Gr\"{o}bner Basis method. To guarantee the
  method to terminate a total ordering of unknowns and their
  derivatives has to be introduced. This ordering determines which
  highest powers of unknowns are to be eliminated next or which
  highest order derivatives have to be eliminated next using integrability
  conditions. Often such eliminations lead to exponential growth of
  the generated equations. In the package {\sc Crack} such
  computations are executed with only a low priority. Operations have
  a higher priority which reduce the length of equations,
  irrespective of any orderings. Violating any ordering a finite
  number of times still guarantees a finite algorithm. The potential
  gain is large as described next.

% \item[Comparison with other Packages]
% Wide field, each package has strengths, strength of {\sc Crack}
% lies  in its integration module including its recent extension to use
% conservation laws of syzygies for integration \cite{},
\subsection{Exploiting Bi-linearity}
  In bi-linear algebraic problems we have 2 sets of variables
  $a_1,..,a_m$ and $b_1,..,b_n$ such that all equations have
  the form $0=\sum_{k=1}^l \gamma_k a_{i_k}b_{j_k}, \ \gamma_k \in G$.
  Although the
  problem is linear in the $a_i$ and linear in the $b_j$ it still is a
  non-linear problem. A guideline which helps keeping the structure of
  the system during computation relatively simple is to preserve the
  linearity of either the $a_i$ or the $b_j$ as long as possible. In
  classification problems of integrable systems
  the ansatz for the symmetry/first integral
  usually involves more terms and therefore more constants (called
  $b_j$ in applications of {\sc Crack}) than the ansatz for the
  integrable system (with constants $a_i$).  A good strategy therefore
  is to keep the system linear in the $b_j$ during the computation,
  i.e.\ to
  \begin{itemize}
  \item substitute only a $b_j$ in terms of $a_i, b_k$, or an $a_i$
    in terms of an $a_k$ but not an $a_i$ in terms of any $b_k$,
  \item do elimination steps for any $b_j$ or for an
    $a_i$ if the involved equations do not contain any $b_k$.
  \end{itemize}
  The proposed measures are effective not only for algebraic problems
  but for ODEs/PDEs too (i.e.\ to preserve linearity of a sub-set of
  functions as long as possible).
  {\em \{flin\_\} }

\subsection{Occurrence of sin, cos or other special functions}

  If the equations to be solved involve special functions, like $\sin$
  and $\cos$ then one is inclined to add {\tt let}-rules for simplifying
  expressions. Before doing this the simplification rules at the end of
  the file {\tt crinit.red} should be inspected such that new rules do
  not lead to cycles with existing rules. One possibility is to replace
  existing rules, for example to substitute the existing rule \\
  \verb+  trig1_:={sin(~x)**2 => 1-cos(x)**2}$ + \\ by the new rule \\
  \verb+  trig1_:={cos(~x)**2 => 1-sin(x)**2}$ +.\\
  These rules are switched off when integrations are performed in order
  not to interfere with the {\sc Reduce} Integrator.

  Apart from an initial customization of let-rules to be used during the
  whole run one can also specify and clear let-rules during a
  computation using the interactive commands {\tt lr,cr}.

\subsection{Exchanging time for memory}
  The optimal order of applying different methods to the equations of a system
  is not fixed. It does depend, for example, on the distributions of
  unknown functions in the
  equations and on what the individual method would produce in the next
  step. For example, it is possible that the
  decoupling module which applies integrability conditions through cross
  differentiations of equations is going well up to a stage when it
  suddenly produces huge equations. They not only occupy much memory,
  they also are slow to handle.
  Right {\em before} this explosion started other methods should
  have been tried (shortening of equations, any integrations, solution of
  underdetermined ODEs if there are any,...). These alternative methods are normally
  comparatively slow or unfavourable as they introduce new functions but
  under the current circumstances they may be perfect to avoid any growth
  and to complete the calculation. How could one have known beforehand that some
  method will lead to an explosion? One does not know. But one can
  regularly make a backup with the interactive {\tt sb} command and
  restart at this situation if necessary.

\subsection{Customization}
  The addition of new modules to perform new specialized computations
  is easy.  Only the input and output of any new module are fixed.
  The input consists of the system of equations, the list of
  inequalities and the list of unknowns to be computed. The output
  includes the new system of equations and new intermediate
  results. The module name has to be added to a list of all modules
  and a one line description has to be added to a list of
  descriptions.  This makes it easy for users to add special
  techniques for the solution of systems with extra structure. A dummy
  template module {\em \{58\} } is already added and has only to be
  filled with content.

\subsection{Debugging}
  A feature, useful mainly for debugging is that in the middle of an
  ongoing interactive computation the program can be changed by
  loading a different version of {\sc Crack} procedures. Thus one
  could advance quickly close to the point in the execution where an
  error occurs, load a version of the faulty procedure that gives
  extensive output and watch how the fault happens before fixing it.

  The possibility to interrupt REDUCE itself temporarily and to
  inspect the underlying LISP environment {\em \{br\} }
  or to execute LISP commands and to continue with the {\sc Crack}
  session afterwards {\em \{pc\} }
  led to a few improvements and fixes in REDUCE itself.

\section{Technical issues}
\subsection{System requirements}
The required system is {\sc Reduce}, version
3.6. or later. The PSL version is faster whereas
the CSL version seems to be more stable under WINDOWS. Also it
provides a portable compiled code.

Memory requirements depend crucially on the
application. The {\tt crack.rlg} file is produced from running
{\tt crack.tst} in a 4MB session running {\sc Reduce}, version 3.7 under
{\sc Linux}. On the other hand it is not difficult to formulate problems that
consume any amount of memory.

%% \subsection{Installation}
%% In a running {\sc Reduce} session either do \\
%% \verb+    in "crack.red"$ + \\
%% or, in order to speed up computation, either compile it with
%% \verb+    on comp$ + \\
%% before the above command, or, generate a fast-loading compiled
%% file once with \\

\subsection{Global flags and parameters}
The list below gives a selection of
flags and global parameters that are available, for example,
to fine tune the performance according to specific needs of the system
of equations that is studied. Usually they are not needed and very few
are used regularly by the author. The interactive command that changes the
flag/parameter is given in [ ], default values of the flags/parameters
are given in (). All values can be changed interactively with the {\em as} command.
The values of the flags and parameters can either be
set after loading {\sc Crack} and before starting {\sc Crack} with a
lisp assignment, for example,\\
\verb+lisp(print_:=8)$+ \\ %$
or after starting {\sc Crack} in interactive mode with specific commands,
like {\tt pl} to change specifically the print length determining parameter
{\tt print\_}, or the command {\tt as} to do an assignment.
The values of
parameters/flags can be inspected interactively using {\tt pv}
and changed with {\tt as}.

                   set in algebraic mode before starting {\sc Crack}
                   by {\tt ON/OFF BATCH\_MODE}. Interactive mode can be left

\section{A more detailed description of some of the modules}
The package {\sc Crack} contains a number of modules.
The basic ones are for computing a pseudo differential Gr\"{o}bner
Basis (using integrability conditions in a systematic way), integrating
exact PDEs, separating PDEs, solving DEs containing functions of only
a subset of all variables and solving standard ODEs (of Bernoulli or
Euler type, linear, homogeneous and separable ODEs). These facilities
will be described briefly together with examples. The test file
{\tt crack.tst} demonstrates these and others.

\subsection{Pseudo Differential Gr\"{o}bner Basis}
This module (called `decoupling' in {\tt proc\_list\_})
reduces derivatives in equations by using other equations and it applies
integrability conditions to formulate additional equations which are
subsequently reduced, and so on.

A general algorithm to bring a system of PDEs into a standard form
where all integrability conditions are satisfied by applying
a finite number of additions, multiplications and differentiations
is based on the general theory of involutive systems \cite{Riq,Th,Ja}.

Essential to this theory is a total ordering of partial derivatives
which allows assignment to each PDE of a {\em Leading Derivative}
(LD) according to a chosen ordering of functions
and derivatives. Examples for possible orderings are
\begin{description}
\item lex.\ order of functions $>$ lex.\ order of variables,
\item lex.\ order of functions $>$ total differential order $>$ lex.\
      order of variables,
\item total order $>$ lex.\ order of functions $>$ lex.\ order of variables
\end{description}
or mixtures of them by giving weights to individual functions and variables.
Above, the `$>$' indicate ``before'' in priority of criteria. The principle
is then to
\begin{description}
\item[\ \ ] take two equations at a time and differentiate them as often as
necessary to get equal LDs,
\item[\ \ ]  regard these two equations as algebraic equations in
the common LD and calculate the remainder w.r.t.\ the LD, i.e.\ to
generate an equation without the LD by the Euclidean algorithm, and
\item[\ \ ]  add this equation to the system.
\end{description}
Usually pairs of equations are taken first, such that only one
of both equations must be
differentiated. If in such a generation step one of both equations is not
differentiated then it is called a
simplification step and this equation will be replaced by the new equation.

The algorithm ends if each combination of two equations yields only equations
which simplify to an identity modulo the other equations.
A more detailed description is given e.g. in \cite{Alex,Reid1}.

Other programs implementing this algorithm are described e.g. in
\cite{FS,Alex,Fush,Reid1,Reid2,Reid3} and \cite{Mans}.

In the interactive mode of {\sc Crack} it is possible to change the
lexicographical ordering of variables, of functions, to choose between
`total differential order' ordering of variables or lexicographical
ordering of variables and to choose whether lexicographical ordering
of functions should have a higher priority than the ordering of the
variables in a derivative, or not.

An example of the computation of a differential Gr\"{o}bner Basis is
given in the test file {\tt crack.tst}.

\subsection{Integrating exact PDEs}
The technical term `exact' is adapted for PDEs from exterior calculus and
is a small abuse of language but it is useful to characterize the kind of PDEs
under consideration.

The purpose of the integration module in {\sc Crack} is to  decide
whether a given differential
expression $D$ which involves unknown functions $f^i(x^j),\;\; 1\leq i\leq m$
of independent variables $x^j, 1\leq j\leq n$
is a total derivative of another expression $I$
w.r.t. some variable $x^k, 1\leq k\leq n$
\[ D(x^i,\; f^j,\; f^j,_p,\; f^j,_{pq}, \ldots)
     = \frac{d I(x^i,\; f^j,\; f^j,_p,\; f^j,_{pq}, \ldots)}{d x^k}. \]
The index $k$ is
reserved in the following for the integration variable $x^k.$
With an appropriate function of integration $c^r,$
which depends on all variables except $x^k$ it is no loss of generality
to replace $0 = D$ by $0 = I + c^r$ in a system of equations.

Of course there
always exists a function $I$ with a total derivative equal to $D$ but
the question is whether for \underline{arbitrary} $f^i$ the integral
$I$ is functionally dependent only on the $f^i$ and their derivatives,
and \underline{not on integrals of $f^i.$} \\
\underline{Preconditions:} \\
$D$ is a polynomial in the $f^i$ and their derivatives. The number of
functions and variables is free.
For deciding the existence of $I$ only, the explicit occurrence of the
variables $x^i$ is arbitrary. In order to actually
calculate $I$ explicitly, $D$ must have the property that all terms in $D$
must either contain an unknown function of $x^k$ or
must be formally integrable w.r.t. $x^k.$
That means if $I$ exists then
only a special explicit occurrence of $x^k$ can prevent the
calculation of $I$
and furthermore only in those terms which do not contain
any unknown function of $x^k.$
If such terms occur in $D$ and $I$ exists then $I$ can still be expressed
as a polynomial in the $f^i, f^i,_j, \ldots$ and terms containing
indefinite integrals with integrands explicit in $x^k.$ \\
\underline{Algorithm:} \\
Successive partial integration of the term with the highest
$x^k$-derivative of any $f^i.$ By that the
differential order w.r.t. $x^k$ is reduced
successively. This procedure is always applicable because steps involve only
differentiations and the polynomial
integration $(\int h^n\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}dx =
h^{n+1}/(n+1))$ where $h$ is a partial derivative of some function
$f^i.$ For a more detailed description see \cite{Wol99e}.\\
\underline{Stop:} \\
Iteration stops if no term with any $x^k$-derivative of any $f^i$ is left.
If any $f^i(x^k)$ occurs in the remaining un-integrated terms
then $I$ is not expressible with $f^i$ and its derivatives only. In
case no $f^i(x^k)$ occurs, then any remaining terms can contain $x^k$ only
explicitly. Whether they can be integrated or not depends on their formal
integrability. For their integration the {\sc Reduce} integrator is
applied. \\
\underline{Speed up:} \\
The partial integration as described above preserves derivatives with
respect to other variables. For example, the three terms $f,_x, f
f,_{xxx}, f,_{xxy}$ can not combine somehow to the same terms in the
integral because if one ignores $x$-derivatives then it is clear that
$f, f^2$ and $f,_y$ are three functionally independent expressions
with respect of $x$-integrations. This allows the following drastic speed up
for large expressions. It is possible to partition the complete sum of
terms into partial sums such that each of them has to be
integrable on its own. That is managed by generating a label for each
term and collecting terms with equal label into partial sums. The
label is produced by dropping all $x$-derivatives from all functions
to be computed and dropping all factors which are not powers of derivatives of
functions to be computed.

The partitioning into partial sums has two effects. Firstly, if the
integration of one partial sum fails then the remaining sums do not have
to be tried for integration. Secondly, doing partial integration for
each term means doing many subtractions. It is much faster to subtract
terms from small sums than from large sums.

\underline{Example :} \\
We apply the above algorithm to
\begin{equation}
D := 2f,_yg' + 2f,_{xy}g + gg'^3 + xg'^4 + 3xgg'^2g'' = 0
\label{D}
\end{equation}
with $f = f(x,y), \, g = g(x), \, '\equiv d/dx.$
Starting with terms containing $g$
and at first with the highest derivative $g,_{xx},$ the steps are
\[
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\int 3xgg,_x^2g,_{xx} dx
& = & \int d(xgg,_x^3)
    & - & \int \left( \partial_x(xg) g,_x^3\right) dx \\ \\
& = & xgg,_x^3 & - & \int g,_x^3(g + xg,_x) dx,
\end{array} \]
\[ I := I + xgg,_x^3 \]
\[ D := D - g,_x^3(g + xg,_x) - 3xgg,_x^2g,_{xx} \]
The new terms $- g,_x^3(g + xg,_x)$ are of lower order than $g,_{xx}$
and so in the expression $D$ the maximal order of $x$-derivatives
of $g$ is lowered. The conditions that $D$ is exact are the following.
\begin{description}
\item The leading derivative must occur linearly before each partial
integration step.
\item After the partial integration of the terms with first order
$x$-derivatives of $f$ the remaining $D$ must not contain $f$
or other derivatives of $f$, because such terms cannot
be integrated w.r.t.\ $x$ without specifying $f$.
\end{description}
The result of $x$- and $y$-integration in the above example is
(remember $g=g(x)$)
\begin{equation}
0 = 2fg + xygg,_x^3 + c_1(x) + c_2(y) \; \; (=I). \nonumber
\end{equation}
{\sc Crack} can now eliminate $f$ and substitute
for it in all other equations. \\
\underline{Generalization:} \\
If after applying the above basic algorithm, terms are left which contain
functions of $x^k$ but each of these functions depends only on a subset of
all $x^i, 1\leq i\leq n,$ then a generalized version of the above algorithm
can still provide a formal expression for the integral $I$
(see \cite{Wol99e}). The price consists of
additional differential conditions, but they are equations in fewer variables
than occur in the integrated equation. Integrating for example
\begin{equation}
\tilde{D} = D + g^2(y^2 + x\sin y + x^2e^y)       \label{Dnew}
\end{equation}
by introducing as few
new functions and additional conditions as possible gives for the integral
$\tilde{I}$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tilde{I} & = & 2fg + xygg,_{x}^{3} + c_1(x) + c_2(y) \\
  &   & + \frac{1}{3}y^3c_3'' - \cos y(xc_3'' - c_3)
+ e^y(x^2c_3'' - 2xc_3' + 2c_3)
\end{eqnarray*}
with $c_3 = c_3(x), \, '\equiv d/dx$ and the single additional
condition $g^2 = c_3'''.$
The integration of the new terms of (\ref{Dnew}) is
achieved by partial integration again, for example
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int g^2x^2 dx & = & x^2\int g^2 dx - \int (2x\!\int g^2 dx) dx \\
& = & x^2\int g^2 dx - 2x\int\!\!\int g^2 dx
+ 2 \int\!\!\int\!\!\int g^2 dx \\
& = & x^2c_3'' - 2xc_3' + 2c_3.
\end{eqnarray*}
\underline{Characterization:} \\
This algorithm is a decision algorithm which does not involve any
heuristic.
After integration, the new equation is still a polynomial
in $f^i$ and in the new constant or function of integration.
Therefore the algorithms for bringing the system into standard form can still
be applied to the PDE-system
after the equation $D = 0$ is replaced by $I = 0.$

The complexity of algorithms for bringing a PDE-system into a standard
form depends nonlinearly on the order of these equations because of
the nonlinearly increasing number of different leading derivatives
and by that the number of equations generated intermediately by such
an algorithm. It therefore in general pays off to integrate equations
during such a standard form algorithm.

If an $f^i,$ which depends on all variables, can be eliminated after an
integration, then depending on its length
it is in general helpful to substitute $f^i$ in other equations and
to reduce the number of equations and functions by one. This is especially
profitable if the replaced expression is short and
contains only functions of fewer variables than $f^i.$ \\
\underline{Test:} \\
The corresponding test input is
\begin{verbatim}
depend f,x,y;
depend g,x;
crack({2*df(f,y)*df(g,x)+2*df(f,x,y)*g+g*df(g,x)**3
       +x*df(g,x)**4+3*x*g*df(g,x)**2*df(g,x,2)
       +g**2*(y**2+x*sin y+x**2*e**y)},
      {},{f,g},{});
\end{verbatim}
The meaning of the {\sc Reduce} command {\tt depend} is to declare that $f$
depends in an unknown way on $x$ and $y$. For more details on the
algorithm see \cite{Wol99e}.

\subsection{Direct separation of PDEs}
As a result of repeated integrations the functions in the
remaining equations have fewer and fewer variables. It therefore may happen
that after a substitution an equation results where at least one variable
occurs only explicitly and not as an argument of an unknown function.
Consequently all coefficients of linearly independent expressions in this
variable can be set to zero individually. \\
{\em Example:}  \\
$f = f(x,y), \;\; g = g(x), \;\; x,y,z$ are independent variables.
The equation is
\begin{equation}
0 = f,_y + z(f^2+g,_x) + z^2(g,_x+yg^2) \label{sep}
\end{equation}
$x$-separation? $\rightarrow$ no  \\
$y$-separation? $\rightarrow$ no  \\
$z$-separation? $\rightarrow$ yes: $0 \,=\, f,_y \,=\, f^2+g,_x \,=\,
g,_x+yg^2$ \\
$y$-separation? $\rightarrow$ yes: $0 = g,_x = g^2\;\;$
(from the third equation from the $z$-separation)

If $z^2$ had been replaced in (\ref{sep}) by a third
function $h(z)$ then direct separation would not have been possible.
The situation changes if $h$ is a parametric function which is
assumed to be independently given and which should not be
calculated, i.e.\ $f$ and $g$ should be calculated for any
arbitrary given $h(z)$. Then the same separation could have been
done with an extra treatment of the special case $h,_{zz} = 0,$
i.e.\ $h$ linear in $z$. This different treatment of unknown functions
makes it necessary to input explicitly the functions to be
calculated as the third argument to {\sc Crack}. The input
in this case would be
\begin{verbatim}
depend f,x,y;
depend g,x;
depend h,z;
crack({df(f,y)+z*f**2+(z+h)*df(g,x)+h*y*g**2},{},{f,g},{z});
\end{verbatim}
The fourth parameter for {\sc Crack} is necessary to make clear that
in addition to the variables of $f$ and $g$, $z$ is also an independent
variable.

If the flag {\tt independence\_} is not {\tt nil} then {\sc Crack} will
stop if linear independence of the explicit expressions of the
separation variable (in the example $1,z,z^2$) is not clear and ask
interactively whether separation should be done or not.

\subsection{Indirect separation of PDEs}
For the above direct separation a precondition is that at least one
variable occurs only explicitly or as an argument of parametric
functions.  The situation where each variable is an argument of at least
one function but no function contains all independent variables of an
equation needs a more elaborate treatment.

The steps are these
\begin{itemize}
\item A variable $x_a$ is chosen which occurs in as few functions as possible.
 This variable will be separated directly later which
 requires that all unknown functions $f_i$ containing $x_a$ are to be
 eliminated. Therefore, as long as $F:=\{f_i\}$ is not empty do the following:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Choose the function $f_i(y_p)$ in $F$ with the smallest number of
  variables $y_p$ and with $z_{ij}$ as those variables on which $f_i$ does
  not depend.
  \item Identify all different products $P_{ik}$ of powers of
  $f_i$-derivatives and of $f_i$ in the equation.
  Determine the $z_{ij}$-dependent factors $C_{ik}$ of the coefficients
  of $P_{ik}$ and store them in a list.
  \item For each $C_{il}$ ($i$ fixed, $l=1,\ldots)$ choose a $z_{ij}$ and :
  \begin{itemize}
   \item divide by $C_{il}$ the equation and all following elements
         $C_{im}$ with $m>l$ of this list, such that these elements are
         still the actual coefficients in the equation after the division,
   \item differentiate the equation and the $C_{im}, m>l$ w.r.t.\ $z_{ij}$
  \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
 \item The resulting equation no longer contains any unknown function of $x_a$
 and can be separated w.r.t.\ $x_a$ directly in case $x_a$ still occurs
 explicitly. In both cases the equation(s) is (are) free of $x_a$ afterwards
 and inverting the sequence of integration and multiplication
 of all those equations (in case of direct separability) will also result
 in an equation(s) free of $x_a.$ More exactly, the steps are
 \begin{itemize}
  \item multiplication of the equation(s) and the $C_{im}$ with
        $m<l$ by the elements
  of the $C_{ik}$-lists in exactly the inverse order,
  \item integration of these exact PDEs and the $C_{im}$ w.r.t.\ $z_{ij}$.
 \end{itemize}
 \item The equations originating that way are used to evaluate those
 functions which do not depend on $x_a$ and which survived in the above
 differentiations. Substituting these functions in the original equation,
 may enable direct separability w.r.t. variables on which the $f_i$
 do not depend on.
 \item The whole procedure is repeated for another variable $x_b$ if the
 original DE could not be separated directly and still has the property that
 it contains only functions of a subset of all variables in the equation.
\end{itemize}
The additional bookkeeping of coefficients $C_{ik}$ and their updating by
division, differentiation, integration and multiplication is done to use
them as integrating factors for the backward integration.
The following example makes this clearer. The equation is
\begin{equation}
0 = f(x) g(y) - \frac{1}{2}xf'(x) - g'(y) - (1+x^2)y. \label{isep}
\end{equation}
The steps are (equal levels of indentation in the example correspond to
those in the algorithm given above)
\begin{itemize}
 \item $x_1:=x, \, F=\{f\}$
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Identify $f_1:=f, \; \; \; \; \; y_1:=x, \; \; \; \; \; z_{11}:=y$
  \item and $P_1=\{f',f\}, \; \; \; \; \; C_1=\{1,g\}$
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Divide $C_{12}$ and
         (\ref{isep}) by $C_{11}=1$ and differentiate w.r.t. $z_{11}=y:$
         \begin{eqnarray}
         0 & = & fg' - g'' - (1+x^2)   \label{isep2}  \\
         C_{12} & = & g'    \nonumber
         \end{eqnarray}
 \item Divide (\ref{isep2}) by $C_{12}=g'$ and differentiate w.r.t. $z_{11}=y:$
\[ 0 = - (g''/g')' - (1+x^2)(1/g')' \]

  \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
 \item Direct separation w.r.t.\ $x$ and integration:
 \[\begin{array}{rclclcl}
  x^2: 0 & = & (1/g')' & \Rightarrow & c_1g' =  1 & \Rightarrow &
        g = y/c_1 + c_2 \\
  x^0: 0 & = & (g''/g')' & \Rightarrow & c_3g' = g'' & \Rightarrow &
        c_3 = 0
 \end{array} \]
 \item Substitution of $g$ in the original DE
       \[0 = (y/c_1+c_2)f - \frac{1}{2}xf' - 1/c_1 - (1+x^2)y \]
       provides a form which allows {\sc Crack} standard methods to succeed
       by direct separation w.r.t.\ $y$
 \[\begin{array}{rclcl}
  y^1: 0 & = & f/c_1 - 1 - x^2               & \Rightarrow & f'  =  2c_1x \\
  y^0: 0 & = & c_2f - \frac{1}{2}xf' - 1/c_1 & \Rightarrow & 0   =
       c_2c_1(1+x^2) - c_1x^2 - 1/c_1
 \end{array}\]
       and direct separation w.r.t.\ $x$:
 \begin{eqnarray*}
 x^0:  0 & = & c_2c_1 - c_1    \\
 x^2:  0 & = & c_2c_1 - 1/c_1   \\
    & \Rightarrow &  0 = c_1 - 1/c_1   \\
    & \Rightarrow & c_1 = \pm 1 \Rightarrow c_2 = 1.
 \end{eqnarray*}
\end{itemize}
We get the two solutions $f = 1 + x^2, g = 1 + y$ and
$f = - 1 - x^2, g = 1 - y.$ The corresponding input to {\sc Crack} would be
\begin{verbatim}
depend f,x;
depend g,y;
crack({f*g-x*df(f,x)/2-df(g,y)-(1+x**2)*y},{},{f,g},{});
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Solving standard ODEs}
For solving standard ODEs the package {\sc ODESolve} by Malcalm MacCallum and
Francis Wright
\cite{Mal} is applied. This package is distributed with {\sc Reduce}
and can be used independently of {\sc Crack}. The syntax of
{\sc ODESolve} is quite similar to that of {\sc Crack} \\
\verb+depend+ {\it function}, {\it variable}; \\
\verb+odesolve(+ODE, {\it function}, {\it variable});  \\
In the present form (1998) it solves standard first order ODEs
(Bernoulli and Euler type, with separable variables, $\ldots$) and linear
higher order ODEs with constant coefficients.
An improved version is currently under preparation by Francis Wright.
The applicability of {\sc ODESolve} is
increased by a {\sc Crack}-subroutine which recognizes such PDEs in which
there is only one unknown function of all variables and all occurring
derivatives of this function
are only derivatives w.r.t. one variable of only one partial derivative.
For example the PDE for $f(x,y)$
\[ 0 = f,_{xxy} + f,_{xxyy} \]
can be viewed as a first order ODE in $y$ for $f,_{xxy}.$
