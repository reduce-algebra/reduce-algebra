\section{Purpose}
Procedures of this package perform computationally expensive and
non-trivial computations with polynomials of products of 3-component vectors.
The individual procedures can be grouped into the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item initialization of the package,
\item generation of scalar vector expressions according to a multiple
      weighting scheme where each vector has multiple weights,
\item conversions of scalar vector expressions between different
      representations,
\item the computation of Poisson brackets between vector expressions,
\item a computation determining whether a given scalar vector expression
      is functionally depending on a list of other scalar vector expressions.
\end{itemize}
A possible application of these procedures is the classification of
integrable `vectorial' Hamiltonians, the study whether obtained
expressions are functionally independent of known expressions and
the compactification of results for publication.

These routines were designed and implemented to support the classification
of integrable Hamiltonians. Examples are chosen from this application.
More details are given in \cite{SoWo04}.

\section{Notation}
The chosen conventions aim to display large vector expressions as
compact as possible. All vectors have 3 components and are
represented by a single letter, like $A$ or $B$. In this manual we use
capital letters in mathematical formulas and lower case letters for REDUCE
input and output. REDUCE is not case sensitive but output shows in lower
case letters. Vector components have an extra digit 1, 2 or 3, like $A2,
B3$. Products of vectors are represented by a single identifier where
the following convention is used: $ABCD...$ stands for $(A\ ,\ B
\times (C \times (D \times ...)))$ where $(\ ,\ )$ denotes the
scalar vector product and $\times$ the skew symmetric vector
product. For example, we have $AB = (A,B)$ and $ABC=(A,B\times C)$.
In the following we distinguish between three forms of scalar vector
expressions:
\begin{description}
\item[- the component form] involving only the components
        $A1,A2,A3,B1,...$,
\item[- the standard vector form] involving only scalar products
        $AB\,(=(A,B))$ and triple products $ABC\,(=(A,B \times C))$,
\item[- the extended vector form] involving any product $ABCD...$.
\end{description}
Because of the commutativity of the scalar product $(A,B)=(B,A)$ there
seem to be two identifiers $AB$ and $BA$ suited to represent the same
product. Similarly for triple products we have the relation
$ABC=BCA=CAB=-ACB=-CBA=-BAC$. In order to have an unambiguous
notation such that vanishing rational expressions simplify to zero we
adopt then convention that for scalar products and triple products
only identifiers are used in which letters are sorted
alphabetically. For example, the program uses {\it AB,AV,ABV,BUV} but
not {\it BA,VA,BVA,VBU}. In order to simplify manual input one can
assign expressions using identifiers, like {\it BA,BUA}, and afterwards
convert them into proper notation using the procedure {\tt
e2s} (see below or the beginning of the file {\tt v3tools.tst}).

In order to use non-vectorial parameters, like {\it ALPHA} or {\it BETA2}
every non-vectorial parameter is preceded by {\tt !\&}, e.g.\
one would input {\tt !\&alpha} or {\tt !\&beta2}.

\section{Initialization}
Scalar and triple products of 3-component vectors satisfy
identities, for example, the four vectors $A,B,U,V$ satisfy
\[ 0 = AB\ BUV - ABU\ BV + ABV\ BU - AUV\ BB. \]
Therefore, scalar vector expressions, i.e.\ polynomials of scalar
vector products do usually not have a unique form. They can be
re-written using these identities, for example, in order to minimize
the number of terms of the polynomial or to bring the expression into
a canonical form. Sometimes computations have to
be done modulo these identities, more precisely, modulo a Gr\"{o}bner
basis of these identities. The computation of the identities and their
Gr\"{o}bner basis has to be done only once with the procedure {\tt
vinit} which initializes the global variables {\tt v\_,gbase\_,heads\_}.
The procedure {\tt vinit} takes as argument the list of
all vectors that occur in the computation, for example,
{\tt vinit(\{u,v,w,z\})}. In the default case of
vectors {\tt a,b,u,v} the global variables {\tt v\_,gbase\_,heads\_}
are already assigned and {\tt vinit} does not have to be called
initially. But if some of the vectors satisfy a special relation, like
$AB=0$ then this relations should be assigned (like {\tt ab:=0;})
and {\tt vinit} should be run afterwards. Here an overview of the three global
variables:
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt v\_}] : a list of vectors involved in all the computations.
      The global variable {\tt v\_} is needed in the procedure
      {\tt poisson\_v}. The default value is {\tt v\_=\{a,b,u,v\}} .
\item[{\tt gbase\_}] : a list of polynomials which are a Gr\"{o}bner
      basis for all identities between scalar products % {\tt (A,B)}
      {\it AB} and triple products {\it ABC} % {\tt (A,B$\times$C)}
      of any vectors in the list {\tt v\_}.
\item[{\tt heads\_}] : a list of leading terms of the polynomials in
      {\tt gbase\_}.
\end{description}

\section{Main Routines}
Which routines work only for homogeneous vectorial expressions and
which for any vectorial expressions?
\begin{description}
  \item[vinit] :
        initializes all three global variables {\tt vl\_, gbase\_, heads\_}
        for a given list of vectors. This procedure is not necessary if the
        list of vectors is {\it A,B,U,V}. The procedure is necessary if some
        of the vectors satisfy extra conditions, like {\it AB=0}.
        Example: \begin{verbatim}
vinit({a,b,c,d}); \end{verbatim}
  \item[e2s] :
        converts a vectorial polynomial from extended vector form into standard
        vector form by replacing products {\it ABCD...} through scalar
        and triple products. Example: \begin{verbatim}
e2s(buuav);  -->  abv*uu - auv*bu \end{verbatim}
        It is also useful to convert from
        standard vector form into standard vector form if one wants
        to sort factors in scalar and triple products lexicographically.
        This is useful for working with this package on expressions
        that have been generated outside this package and that do not obey
        the lexicographical ordering of factors.
        Example: \begin{verbatim}
e2s(avb*uu + uva*bu);  -->  - abv*uu + auv*bu \end{verbatim}
  \item[v2c] : converts an expression from any vector form (extended or
        standard) into component form. Example: \begin{verbatim}
v2c(abu); --> a1*b2*u3-a1*b3*u2-a2*b1*u3+a2*b3*u1+a3*b1*u2-a3*b2*u1\end{verbatim}
  \item[c2sl] : converts an expression from component form into
  standard vector form. The resulting vector expression is returned
  partitioned as a list of sublists. Each sublist contains expressions
  with the same multiplicity of each vector (the same homogeneity).
  The first expression of
  each list is the vector equivalent of the corresponding input terms
  in component form. All other expressions in each sublist are
  identically vanishing vector expressions, i.e.\ vector identities
  with the same multiplicity as the first expression in each
  sublist. That means, the second, third,... expression in each
  sublist multiplied with a constant could be added to the first
  expression of each sublist in order to change its form but not its
  value. Example: \begin{verbatim}
c2sl(a1*b2*u3 - a1*b3*u2 - a2*b1*u3 + a2*b3*u1 + a3*b1*u2 - a3*b2*u1 +
     a1*b1*b2*u3*v1 - a1*b1*b2*u1*v3 + a1*b1*b3*u1*v2 - a1*b1*b3*u2*v1 -
     a1*b2**2*u2*v3 + a1*b2**2*u3*v2 - a1*b3**2*u2*v3 + a1*b3**2*u3*v2 +
     a2*b1**2*u1*v3 - a2*b1**2*u3*v1 + a2*b1*b2*u2*v3 - a2*b1*b2*u3*v2 +
     a2*b2*b3*u1*v2 - a2*b2*b3*u2*v1 + a2*b3**2*u1*v3 - a2*b3**2*u3*v1 -
     a3*b1**2*u1*v2 + a3*b1**2*u2*v1 + a3*b1*b3*u2*v3 - a3*b1*b3*u3*v2 -
     a3*b2**2*u1*v2 + a3*b2**2*u2*v1 - a3*b2*b3*u1*v3 + a3*b2*b3*u3*v1 );

--> {{abu},{abu*bv - abv*bu, ab*buv - abu*bv + abv*bu - auv*bb}}
\end{verbatim}
  The input expression is equal to the sum of the first expressions of
  all sublists, i.e.\ equal {\it ABU + ABU BV - ABV BU}. The second
  expression of the second sublist is an identity,
  i.e.\ {\it 0=AB BUV - ABU BV + ABV BU - AUV BB}, where each vector
  occurs in each term equally often as in each term of the first expression
  in the second sublist.
  \item[c2s] : is equivalent to {\tt c2sl} with the difference that all %first
  expressions of all sublists are added up with all identity expressions
  obtaining a coefficient \verb+!&c1, !&c2,...+. Example: \begin{verbatim}
c2s( same input as for c2sl );
--> abu + abu*bv - abv*bu + !&c1*(ab*buv - abu*bv + abv*bu - auv*bb)\end{verbatim}
  \item[s2s] : generates and uses vector identities to reduce the length of an
        expression in standard vector form. Example: \begin{verbatim}
s2s( - abu*vv + abv*uv + av*buv);  -->  auv*bv \end{verbatim}
  \item[s2e] : like s2s but also uses identities involving products
        $ABCD..$ and thus transforms standard vector form into extended
        vector form. Example:
        \begin{verbatim}
s2e(abv*uu - auv*bu);  -->  buuav \end{verbatim}
        In its current form it only uses products that involve all
        the vectors involved in each term of the standard vector form.
        In the above example it would not try to use products with 4
        factors but only with 5 factors, like {\tt buuav}.
  \item[genpro] : generation of all scalar and triple products for a given
        vector list. Example: \begin{verbatim}
genpro({a,b,u,v}); --> {aa,ab,au,av,bb,bu,bv,uu,uv,vv,abu,abv,auv,buv} \end{verbatim}
  \item[genpro\_wg] :
        similar to {\tt genpro} with the difference that each vector
        is accompanied by a list of weights and the resulting scalar
        and triple products also come with a list of weights.
        Example: \begin{verbatim}
genpro_wg({{a,1,0,0},{b,0,1,0},{u,0,0,1},{v,1,0,1}});
--> {{aa,2,0,0},{ab,1,1,0},{au,1,0,1},{av,2,0,1},{bb,0,2,0},
     {bu,0,1,1},{bv,1,1,1},{uu,0,0,2},{uv,1,0,2},{vv,2,0,2},
     {abu,1,1,1},{abv,2,1,1},{auv,2,0,2},{buv,1,1,2}} \end{verbatim}
  \item[poisson\_c] :
     computes the poisson bracket of two arbitrary expressions. This
     procedure needs as input the Poisson structure matrix which we
     call {\tt struc\_cons} below. This is encoded as a list of lists,
     specifying all non-vanishing Poisson brackets between any two
     dynamical variables, here {\tt u1,u2,u3,v1,v2,v3}. For example,
     the first sublist {\tt \{u1,u2,u3\}} of {\tt struc\_cons} below,
     encodes the Poisson bracket relation $\{U1,U2\}=-\{U2,U1\}=U3$.
     Poisson brackets associated to other Lie-algebras are appended to
     the file {\tt v3tools.red}. The structure matrix below encodes
     the Lie-Poisson bracket $e(3)$ for {\tt !\&kap=0}, $so(4)$ for
     {\tt !\&kap=1} and $so(3,1)$ for {\tt !\&kap=-1}.  {\tt
     poisson\_c} needs {\it all} of its arguments in component form.
     Example: \begin{verbatim}
ham:=v2c(ab*uu-2*au*bu+buv)$
fi :=v2c(bu*(2*auv-!&kap*uu+vv))$
!&kap:=-a1**2-a2**2-a3**2$
struc_cons:={{u1,u2, u3}, {u2,u3, u1}, {u3,u1, u2},
             {u1,v2, v3}, {u2,v3, v1}, {u3,v1, v2},
             {u1,v3,-v2}, {u2,v1,-v3}, {u3,v2,-v1},
             {v1,v2, !&kap*u3}, {v2,v3, !&kap*u1}, {v3,v1, !&kap*u2}}$

poisson_c(ham,fi,struc_cons);  -->  0 \end{verbatim}
The example shows that {\tt fi} is a first integral of {\tt ham} under the
assumption {\tt !\&kap = - aa}. Note that {\tt !\&kap} could not have
been expressed in terms of components of vectors before assigning {\tt fi}
as then the argument to {\tt v2c} would not be a purely vectorial expression.
  \item[poisson\_v] :
     computes the Poisson bracket for two vector expressions.  It uses
     the global variable {\tt gbase\_}. When {\tt poisson\_v} is
     called the first time it computes the Poisson bracket between any
     scalar and triple product once using the procedure {\tt
     poisson\_c} and stores these elementary Poisson brackets under
     the global operator {\tt poi\_}. Therefore, the third argument to
     {\tt poisson\_v} (the Poisson structure matrix) has to be given
     in component form. Example: Compare the following with the
     example for the call of {\tt poisson\_c}. \begin{verbatim}
ham:=ab*uu-2*au*bu+buv$
fi :=bu*(2*auv-!&kap*uu+vv)$
!&kap:=-a1**2-a2**2-a3**2$
struc_cons:={{u1,u2, u3}, {u2,u3, u1}, {u3,u1, u2},
             {u1,v2, v3}, {u2,v3, v1}, {u3,v1, v2},
             {u1,v3,-v2}, {u2,v1,-v3}, {u3,v2,-v1},
             {v1,v2, !&kap*u3}, {v2,v3, !&kap*u1}, {v3,v1, !&kap*u2}}$
!&kap:=-aa$
poisson_v(ham,fi,struc_cons);  -->  0 \end{verbatim}
     When calling {\tt poisson\_v} a second time the computation proceeds
     much faster as the Poisson brackets between scalar and triple products
     had been stored with the operator {\tt poi\_}.
     Note that at first {\tt !\&kap}
     is expressed in component form to have {\tt struc\_cons} in component
     form but afterwards {\tt !\&kap} is expressed in vector form to have
     {\tt ham,fi} in vector form at the time of calling {\tt poisson\_v}.
  \item[gfi] : generates a vector expression with unknown coefficients
     according to a specific list of weights $\{w_1,w_2,...\}$.
     The number of weights is arbitrary but fixed.
     For example, the vector $V$ could be given weights
     $\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}=\{1,0,1\}$ which will be input as {\tt \{v,1,0,1\}}
     in the second argument to {\tt gfi}.
     In the following example vectors $A,B,U,V$ are each given 3 weights
     $\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$ and the most general polynomial is generated where the
     sum of all $\{w_1,w_2,w_3\}$ values of all vectors in each term are
     equal $\{2,1,3\}$. Example: \begin{verbatim}
gfi({2,1,3},
    {{a,1,0,0},{b,0,1,0},{u,0,0,1},{v,1,0,1}},
    {aa, ab, bb, bu, uv, -aa*uu + vv, ab*uu - 2*au*bu + buv},
    heads_
   );
 --> {&r1*abu*uv + &r2*abv*uu + &r3*bv*uv + &r4*auv*bu + &r5*bu*vv
              2
      + &r6*au *bu + &r7*ab*au*uu,
      &r7,&r6,&r5,&r4,&r3,&r2,&r1} \end{verbatim}
  The meaning of the parameters:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item The first parameter of {\tt gfi} is a list of the
                total weights of each term in the generated polynomial.
          \item The second parameter is the list of vectors to be used
                for generating the expression, each comes
                with its list of weight values, like {\tt \{a,1,0,0\}}.
          \item The third parameter is a list of homogeneous vector
                expressions. The polynomial returned by {\tt gfi} must
                not include any expression that is functionally
                dependent on the expressions in this list. In other
                words, from the most general polynomial with proper
                homogeneity that is generated at first within {\tt gfi}
                terms are
                dropped so that it is not possible to choose in the
                remaining polynomial the undetermined coefficients
                {\tt !\&r1,!\&r2,...} such that an expression results
                which is functionally dependent only on the
                expressions of the third parameter list.  In this
                example we want to formulate an ansatz for a first
                integral that is functionally independent of the
                expressions
{\tt aa, ab, bb} (because $A,B$ are assumed to be constant vectors and
$U,V$ to be dynamical vectors), {\tt bu} (a known first integral),
{\tt uv, -aa*uu + vv} (two Casimirs, i.e.\ first integrals) and
{\tt (ab*uu - 2*au*bu + buv)} which is the Hamiltonian.  The third parameter
prevents the generation of the term {\tt bu*aa*uu} which also has weights
$\{2,1,3\}$ (as {\tt b} has weights $\{0,1,0\}$, {\tt u} has weights
$\{0,0,1\}$ and {\tt a} has weights $\{1,0,0\}$). The term {\tt bu*aa*uu}
is dropped because the resulting polynomial would otherwise contain the
functionally dependent expression {\tt bu*(-aa*uu+vv)}.
          \item The fourth parameter is the list of leading terms of
                the Gr\"{o}bner basis of identities between the
                vectors. The resulting polynomial contains only terms
                which are not a multiple of any one of the terms in
                this list. By excluding terms which are not multiples
                of leading terms of identities in the Gr\"{o}bner
                basis one defines a canonical form which vanishes
                only if all terms vanish.
         \end{enumerate}
     The result of {\tt gfi} is a list.
     Its first element is the most general polynomial that has the required
     properties. The list of undetermined coefficients
     {\tt !\&r..} is appended.
  \item[fnc\_dep] : investigates whether a given
     vectorial expression (the first parameter) is
     functionally dependent on the elements of a list (the
     second parameter). The third parameter is the list of
     occurring vectors with their weights. In the following example it is to be
     checked whether the first integral {\tt finew} is new or merely the known
     one {\tt fiold} in disguised form. Example: \begin{verbatim}
ham:=ab*uu-1/2*au*bu+buv$
fiold:=bu**2*((bu*aa-ab*au)**2*uu+2*(bu*aa-ab*au)*(bu*auv-buv*au)
       -vv*abu**2-(bu*av-bv*au)**2-uu*vv*ab**2+aa*uu*vv*bb)$
