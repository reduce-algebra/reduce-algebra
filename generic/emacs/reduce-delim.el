;;; Commentary:

;; Based closely on Emacs 26 paren.el --- highlight matching paren

;; Display highlighting on whatever group or block delimiter matches
;; the one before or after point.

;; In a REDUCE mode buffer, execute ‘M-x reduce-show-delim-mode’ to
;; toggle this buffer-local minor mode.  When on, it will display
;; highlighting on whatever group or block delimiter matches the one
;; before or after point.

;; You can also customize the variable ‘reduce-show-delim-mode-on’ to
;; turn this mode on initially in every REDUCE mode buffer.

;;; Add matching of delim AROUND point later???
