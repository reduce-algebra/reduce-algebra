.SH NAME
breduce - A batch processing facility for REDUCE-
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B breduce
.RI [ configfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
breduce takes as input several reduce files
containing input data plus a configuration file. It produces as
output a LaTeX document with the formatted results of all
computations specified in the configuration file. Important features
include the systematic application of all combinations of a choice
of reduce switches and a mechanism for limiting the runtime
of the single computations.
