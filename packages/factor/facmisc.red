% Here I have code that can test any number up to 2^27-1 for primality. It
% uses Miller-Rabin with two carefully chosen bases such that in that
% range there are only two strong pseudoprime left over, so a rather simple
% test copes with those.
% Note that when the code in this file was first implemented Miller had
% published a deterministic prime test that relied on the Extended Riemenn
% Hyposthesis, but Rabin not developed the probabilistic varient, and
% computer searches to find "good" bases to use in tests for finite ranges
% had not had a chance to get very far! So it is not really incompetence that
% the original code here was less good!

% My choice of 2^27-1 is driven by the fact that CSL and the 32-bit version
% of PSL have that as their largest "fixnum". 64-bit PSL and future 64-bit
% versions of CSL can support larger fixnums, but then the prime checking
% needs at least an test using a further modulus, or other cleverness. It is
% also driven by a balance - to cover a larger range (say up to 2^32 or 2^48)
% would leave the code that tests for primality slower... and finding good
% bases to use in the testing would be harder. Well if you do a web search you
% will find the clever idea of using just ONE Miller-Rabin test using a base
% obtained by hashing the number that is to be tested, and a modest size
% hash table and that trick lets you test primes up to 32-bits rather fast,
% while more elaborate versions with only a couple of Miller-Rabin tests can
% cope with 64-bit inputs.... What I have here is good enough for now!
