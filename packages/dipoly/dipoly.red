% Modifications :
%
% 14-Dec-1994(HM):  Term order GRADED added .
%
% 17-Sep-1994(HM):  The ideal variables are now declared in the TORDER
%                    statement .  The calling conventions can be still
%                    used,but are removed from the documents .
%
% 12-Sep-1994(HM):  Make the base coefficient arithmatic call subs2 if
%                    the switch *bcsub2 is on .  This is turned on if
%                    there are roots in the coefficient domain .  Without
%                    subs2 the zero detection would be incomplete in
%                    such cases .
%                    Term order MATRIX added .
%
%  5-Jun-1994(HM):  Introduced zero divisor list for the base
%                    coefficients .  These are polynomial variants of let
%                    rules which Groebner has found for the parameters .

% Constructors and selectors for a distributed polynomial form .

% A distributive polynomial has the following informal syntax :
%
%   <dipoly> ::= dipzero
%                | <exponent vector> . <base coefficient> . <dipoly>

% Vdp2dip modules included .  They could be in a separate package .
