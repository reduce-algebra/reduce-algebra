% Common variable type declarations and macro definitions

% Switches to select solution form where possible -- off by default.
% Can also be set locally by options to odesolve.
switch odesolve_explicit$               % fully explicit
switch odesolve_expand$                 % expand roots of unity
switch odesolve_full$                   % fully explicit and expanded
switch odesolve_implicit$               % not parametric
switch odesolve_noint$                  % turn off selected integrations
switch noint$                           % turn off integration globally
switch odesolve_verbose$                % display ode & conditions
switch odesolve_basis$                  % output basis as linear ODE solution
switch odesolve_noswap$                 % do not swap variables
switch odesolve_norecurse$              % no recursion => noswap
% The `noswap' and `norecurse' switches are mainly for debugging.
switch odesolve_fast$                   % no heuristics => norecurse
% The `fast' switch disables all non-deterministic solution techniques
% (including most of those for nonlinear ODEs of order > 1).  it is
% useful if ODESolve is used as a service routine, including calling
% it recursively in a hook.  It makes ODESolve 1+ behave like the
% odesolve distributed with REDUCE versions up to and including 3.7,
% and so does not affect the odesolve.tst file.
switch odesolve_check$                  % check solution

%% switch odesolve_load_specfn$  !*odesolve_load_specfn := t$
% If on (the default) then autoload the specfn package if a solution
% is returned that involves special functions.  It can be turned off
% to save resources if ODE solutions will not be further manipulated,
% e.g. if conditions will NOT be imposed.

% Switches controlled by ODESolve:
