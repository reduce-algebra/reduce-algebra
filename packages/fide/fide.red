% The FIDE package consists of the following modules:
%
%  DISCRET rules for discretization.
%  EXPRES  for transforming PDES into any orthogonal coordinate system.
%  IIMET   for discretization of PDES by integro-interpolation method.
%  APPROX  for determining the order of approximation of difference
%          scheme
%  CHARPOL for calculation of amplification matrix and characteristic
%          polynomial of difference scheme, which are needed in Fourier
%          stability analysis.
%  HURWP   for polynomial roots locating necessary in verifying the von
%          Neumann stability condition.
%  LINBAND for generating the block of FORTRAN code, which solves a
%          system of linear algebraic equations with band matrix
%          appearing quite often in difference schemes.
%

% Changes since version 1.1:
% Patches in SIMPINTERPOL and SIMPINTT               13/06/91
% Patch in TDIFPAIR                                  08/07/91
% Two FEXPR routines F2VAL, FPLUS changed to MACROs  17/03/92
% Patches in IIM1, AMPMAT, HURW, CHARPOL for 3.5     01/11/93
% Version 1.1.1 of the FIDE package is the result of porting the FIDE
% package version 1.1.0 to REDUCE 3.5.
% Infix uses of NOT removed (not a memq b  ->  not(a memq b) ) ACH
% MAP* functions replaced by FOR EACH syntax         16/03/94
% Version 1.1.2 of the FIDE package is the result of porting the FIDE
% package version 1.1.1 to REDUCE 3.6.
