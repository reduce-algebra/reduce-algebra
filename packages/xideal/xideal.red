% Description:   Tools for calculations with ideals of polynomials in
%               exterior algebra. Uses Groebner basis algorithms
%               described in D Hartley and P A Tuckey, "A direct
%               characterisation of Groebner bases in Clifford and
%               Grassmann algebras", Preprint MPI-Ph/93-96 1993, and J
%               Apel "A relationship between Groebner bases of ideals
%               and vector modules of G-algebras", Contemp
%               Math 131(1992)195.

% Requires:      REDUCE 3.6 patched to 25 Apr 96 or later
%
% Created:          5/8/92  V0      as ideal.red
%
% Modified:      4/3/94  V1      Renamed xideal.red
%                               Compiles independently
%                               Converted right reduction and spolys to
%                               left
%                               Added graded lexicographical ordering
%                               Enabled non-graded ideals
%                               Fixed trivial ideal bug
%                               Removed subform
%                               Renamed xtrace -> xstats
%               1/12/94 V2      Enable 2-sided ideals
%                               Enable p-forms with p >= 0
%               8/12/95  Added subs2 checking in reduction
%               19/1/96 V2.2    Added subs2 checking in xrepartit
%                               Added resimp before subs2
%                               Fixed rtypes of operators
%               16/4/96 V2.3    Added exvars and excoeffs

%
% Algebraic mode entry points
%
% xorder k;
%  establishes the term order, where k is one of lex, gradlex (graded by
%  number of factors in term) or deglex (graded by exterior degree of
%  term.)
%
% xvars U,V,W,...;
%  declares which degree 0 kernels are to be regarded as polynomial
%  variables (rest are coefficient parameters). U,V,W can be variables
%  or lists of variables. xvars nil, restores the default, in which all
%  declared 0-forms are polynomial variables.
%
% xideal(S) xideal(S,V,r) or xideal(S,r)
%  calculates an exterior Groebner basis for the list of generator S,
%  with optional 0-form variables V, optionally up to degree r.
%
% xmodideal(F,S) or F xmodideal S
%  reduces F with respect to an exterior Groebner basis for the list of
%  generators S. F may be either a single exterior form,
%  or a list of forms.
%
% xmod(F,S) or F xmod S
%  reduces F with respect to the set of exterior polynomials S, which is
%  not necessarily a Groebner basis. F may be either a single
%  exterior form, or a list of forms. This routine can be used in
%  conjunction with xideal to produce the same effect as xmodideal:
%         F xmodideal S = F xmod xideal(S,exdegree F).
%
% xauto(S)
%  autoreduces the polynomials in S.
%
% exvars(F)
%  returns polynomials variables (as defined by xvars) from F
%
% excoeffs(F)
%  returns polynomials coefficients (as defined by xvars) from F
%
% Switches
%
% xfullreduce   - Allows reduced Groebner bases to be calculated
%                    (default ON)
% trxideal       - Trace spoly and wedge poly production (default OFF)
% trxmod - Trace reduction to normal form (default OFF)
