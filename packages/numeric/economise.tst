% The economise_series operator takes a power-series representation of
% a function over some (finite) interval and attempts to generate a lower
% degree polynomial that will give an accurate approximation to it.
% It achieves this by succesively eliminating the highest degree term in
% the series using a Chebyshev polynomial. The Chebyshev polynomial that
% is subtracted will lead to a good approximation to a minimax overall
% approximation.

% This first example starts with a simple explicit polynomial of
% degree 5 and trims it down to one of degree 4 where values should
% match reasonably well on the interval -0.5 to +0.5

economise_series(1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 - x^5 + x^6,
                 x = (-1/2 .. 1/2), 4);

% The next two cases generate coefficients suitable for computing sine
% and cosine in the range -pi/4 to +pi/4 such that the result will
% be accurate enough for IEEE-style 128-bit floating point. One illustrates
% use of taylor() to generate the series, while the other uses the tps
% package.
