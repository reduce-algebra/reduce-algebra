% This code has been converted from the normform and Normform packages %
% written by T.M.L. Mulders and A.H.M. Levelt for Maple.               %

% normform contains one switch: looking_good. If using xr, the X       %
% interface for REDUCE, switching this on will improve the appearance  %
% of the output. The switch serves no (useful) purpose in standard     %
% REDUCE (ie: not using xr).                                           %
