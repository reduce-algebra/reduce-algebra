COMMENT
  Revisions:
  30 March 95  Mod 1.96 adds to multroot the capability of solving
                polynomial trees which are determinate but whose
                structure may lack a stairstep pattern of variables,
                or may contain more polynomials than variables.
                Polynomials can now have denominators, which are
                ignored since only the numerators are used.
                  Spurious small real or imaginary parts of complex
                roots, which can arise due to numeric substitution, are
                now detected and eliminated.  However, vital small real
                or imaginary parts are retained (as in the roots
                program.)
                  Error handling is improved.  Each error now returns
                an error message and then multroot(pr,pl) where pr is
                the precision of answers and pl is the equivalent
                polynomial tree whose processing failed. ;
