% Revision 1.9  1998/05/07 12:59:28  seidla
% A new switch pgnopropzero (no propagation of zero) is available. if it is
% switched on, the information about green entries in the system matrix is
% kept only in the condition list. note that pgspsimpl or pgspqe must be
% switched on for the sake of total correctness of the program.--
% If pginfosol is switched on, the printing of the solutions is enhanced: an
% equivalent formula for \and(cl) is given by rl_simpl and an equivalent
% formula for \ex(\and(cl)) (i.e. the satisfiability of cl) is given by rl_qe,
% where cl is the condition list. If pginfosol is switched on note that the
% value returned to algebraic mode is nil.
%
% Revision 1.8  1998/05/06 09:14:50  seidla
% sm_rightsidesmaybenullp renamed to sm_rightsidesarenotredp. A switch
% pgverbose was introduced. A bug was fixed in pg_nullcase but is was not a
% bug. The new procedure cond_inconsistentp was introduced to be used by
% sm_rightsidesarenotredp. Due to this new procedure, right sides may be
% simultaneously checked. The standard example leading to this improvement
% is pg_gauss({(a^2-1)*x=0,0=a+1,0=a-1},{x});
%
% Revision 1.7  1998/04/29 14:39:13  seidla
% Verbose output comming from redlog is suppressed. If both pgspsimpl and
% pgspqe are enabled then simpl is tried first and in case of failure, eq is
% applied. A bug in sm_surep was fixed.
%
% Revision 1.6  1998/04/29 12:30:30  seidla
% Procedure sm_whitecoefficientp renamed to sm_nongreencoefficientp.
% Procedure sm_greenp introduced. sm_whitep (better: nongereenp) is no longer
% used.
% Procedures pg_nullcase and pg_ccase use sm_greenp.
% The new switches pgspsimpl and pgspqe are available and provide andvanced
% methods from the redlog package for sm_surep.
% pg_switchinfo(); is available in algebraic mode.
%
% Revision 1.5  1998/04/29 08:29:18  seidla
% Procedures sm_whitep, sm_redp and sm_surep added to be used in
% sm_rightsidesmaybenull, sm_redcoefficientp and sm_whitecoefficientp.
% Number of parameters of  sm_rightsidesmaybenull, sm_redcoefficientp and
% sm_whitecoefficientp has changed.
%
% Revision 1.4  1998/04/27 14:21:40  seidla
% Conditions in the algorithm were handled as lisp-prefix forms. Now ofsf are
% used.
% The procedure csm_copy(csm) will copy only the corresponding sm, but not the
% conditions for the sake of performance.
%
% Revision 1.3  1998/04/26 16:38:05  seidla
% Data structure "symbolic-mode solution set" is altered. now the values of
% the indeterminants are handled in an alist. this seems to yield a performance
% improvement of 10%. C.f. the test-file for some examples.
% A new switch "pgsourcedirect" is available. if it is enabled, the solutions
% comming from the algorithm are not rearranged. this means e.g., that the
% generic case is the last entry in the solution list.
% The new algebraic-mode function pg_c(n) gives the number of cases considered
% by the algorithm when given the generic nxn case as input.
%
% Revision 1.2  1998/04/?? ??:??:??  seidla
% Data structure of the main part of the algorithm is altered. now premises
% are given downwards and the full conditions are comming from below.
% Non-constructive operators are used as widely as possible.
% Now the solutions and within the solutions the conditions are in the same
% order as they occur during the execution of the algorithm.
%
% Revision 1.1  1998/04/21 11:25:05  seidla
% Initial check-in.
