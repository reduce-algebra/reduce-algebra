%% Evaluate a Reduce call to an algebraic function 'fn' that takes a Reduce list
%% of reals and delivers either a single real or another list of reals.
%% An example where a we use a list as the returned value is in the NLopt interface,
%% rednlopt.c, function red_mfunc_wrap.
%% Awfully tricky!  Needs 'on rounded'.

% ACN explanation: A REDUCE list of floats will have an internal representation
% of the form (list (!:rd!: . 1.111) (!:rd!: . 2.222) (!:rd!: . 3.333)) rather
% than the Lisp version which is simply (1.111 2.222 3.333).  (Anyhow, the
% latter would denote a formula that has the value 1.111 as its leading
% operator; this is most likely an invalid situation).  So I create (fn (list
% (!:rd!: . 1.111) ...  Now to process that and get an algebraic answer I need
% to pass that to the aeval function.  I use errorset, which is a function that
% evaluates something but traps errors, so that if evaluation fails you do not
% lose control.  The extra arguments control how many messages you get on any
% such error.  So what I will evaluate will be a call (aeval (quote (fn (list
% ....  and you see that again to help debug and show what is going on I display
% the raw result that errorset returns.  If that is atomic (the errorp test
% checks for that) here I merely return 0.0.  What is the best thing to do there
% is not clear to me!  Otherwise the CAR of the result of errorset is the actual
% value.  If that is truly a single floating point value as expected, then
% Reduce will have notated that as (!*sq ((!:rd!: . fff) . 1) t).  Now you may
% view that as baroque, but note that when Reduce simplifes a formula the result
% will generally end up as a full algebraic form with variables and operators
% such as trig functions etc left in there, and the representation it uses is
% designed to emcompass all that generality.  For instance the outer (!*sq ...)
% bit helps track when the inner bit remains valid and when it might need to be
% re-simplified because a user has introduced a new LET statement...  So
% cautiously I check that there is !*sq and !:rd!: as predicted.  Finally I
% return the raw floating point number.

% So this procedure manages the interaction between symbolic (Lisp) mode data
% structures and the activation of algebraic mode processing in Reduce, with
% roughly the first half of the function converting in one direction and the
% second converting back.
