%The following is the code to evaluate Airy Functions and their primes

%The first section deals with code that evaluates the Airy Functions.
%The second deals with code that evaluates the Airyprime Functions.

%For the sake of efficiency a recursive approach has been taken for all
%expressions. As a result the equations do not directly resemble those
%given in "The Handbook of Mathematical Functions" (Abramowitz & Stegun)
%although this is the source of the expressions.

% The following procedures evaluate the fseries and gseries which are
% used in the ascending series approach to calculating Airy_Ai and
% Airy_Bi.

algebraic procedure myfseries(z);

%Declared local variables used throughout the procedure.

  begin scalar summ,accu,term,zcube,int1,int2;

%These are the initial values of variables used in the procedure.

     summ := 1;

     int2 := 3;
     accu := 10 ^(-(symbolic !:prec!:));
     term := 1;
     zcube := (z ^ 3);

%This loop calculates term without a check with the accuracy. As a
%result the code is faster and more efficient.

     for kk:=0:30 do
     <<  term := term * zcube / ((int1) * (int2));
         summ := summ + term;
         int1 := int1 + 3;
         int2 := int2 + 3;
      >>;

%Now the check against the accuracy is carried out in order to bring the
% infinite sum to an approximate summation for use later on.

     while abs(term) > accu do

         summ := summ + term;
         int1 := int1 + 3;
         int2 := int2 + 3;
      >>;

%The value of the infinite sum is then returned for use in calculating
%the function.

  return summ;

end;

%This is similar to the above code. As a result the comments above
%are valid here.

%The following procedure calls the above f and g series in order to
%calculate the Airy_Ai and Airy_Bi for specific values of z.
%There is one expression for either the Ai or Bi evaluation. This is
