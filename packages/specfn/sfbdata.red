% The conditional compilation here is so that on a system that does
% not support bignums there is no waste of effort tabulating
% meaningless overflowed values. I have also adjusted this code so that
% it displays the values that it computes at build-time so that especially
% if anything goes wrong it will be possible to observe the progress that
% has been made. The vsl bignum arithmetic is REALLY SLOW so in that case
% I only pre-compute the first 100 not the first 300.

% When I read in save!-bernoulli the macro mk!-bernoulli() will get
% expanded.  This is because of the RLISP flag "*force".  The effect
% will be that the definition of save!-bernoulli() is in effect
% just   bernoulli!-alist := '((....))

% I want to execute save!-bernoulli() just once to initialize the
% table.  That way even if I am running interpreted the painfully
% slow initial calculation of the table gets done only once when
% I first process this chunk of code.
