% Paraset.red determines the parameters !!nfpd, !!nbfpd, and !!maxbflexp
% for floating point numbers.  !!nfpd, !!nbfpd, and !!maxbflexp are
% computed at load, but !!maxbflexp may have to be fixed up at run time
% if !!flexperr is true.
% [March 2015] also compute !!minnorm the smallest normalised floating
% point number. This will mostly be relevant for IEEE arithmetic and will
% end up as just the smallest non-zero number if subnorms are not in use.
% Provide (more or less) portable definitions of tests for infinity, NaN and
% subnorms... with the one for infinity being cheaper than the use of
% explode.

% The following should only ever be used on floating point values. Note

% things that are EQ as being equal, while NaN must not be treated as
% equal even to itself.

% I pre-check for zero so that I do not attempt to compute 1.0/0.0. This
% is because on systems that do not actually have infinities that attempt at
% division could raise an exception. Well even without that situation I can
% worry because if x is a sub-normalised number (eg 1.0e-311) its reciprocal
% could be an IEEE infinity. So my first attempt here was not good enough to
% be safe for PSL. Hence the fact that I only do the division if the absolute
% value of x is at least 1.0e300. So almost all non-infinities will be
% detected by the range check and only the extreme ones fall to the
% reciprocal test.
