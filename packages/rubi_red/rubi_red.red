% *NOTE*
% At present the code here does NOT use the Rubi rewrites to perform any
% integration. The most I will do in the initial set of files here is to
% provide a script that can run the Rubi test files using the existing
% Reduce integration code. Because this task takes several hours to
% complete I will not set it up to be a standard "Reduce test script".
% Rather the user should run the script rubi_red.tst from this directory
% by hand.
%
% So "Work in progress"!   ACN. May 2013.
