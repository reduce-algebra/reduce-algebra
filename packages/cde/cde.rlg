% Loading the interface to cdiff packages; used to generate all
% (even and odd) derivative coordinates,
% (even and odd) principal and parametric derivatives,
% and the restriction of total derivatives to the (even and odd) equation.
% Of course mostly odd part refers to tangent or cotangent covering.

% Initialization of the differential equation.
% The system must be in passive orthonomic form;
% this also means that there will be no nontrivial integrability conditions
% between parametric derivatives.

% right-hand side of the differential equation
de:={u*u_x+u_3x}$



% same construction for odd coordinates

% Define the two Hamiltonian operators for KdV
mk_cdiffop(ham1,1,{1},1);


for all psi1 let ham1(1,1,psi1)=td(psi1,x);


mk_cdiffop(ham2,1,{1},1);


for all psi2 let ham2(1,1,psi2)=(1/3)*u_x*psi2 + td(psi2,x,3)
 + (2/3)*u*td(psi2,x);


% Note: one could equivalently load the operators as superfunctions
% and convert them to operators.

% Convert the two Hamiltonian operators to superfunctions:
conv_cdiff2superfun(ham1,sym1);


conv_cdiff2superfun(ham2,sym2);



% Computes the adjoint and verify skew-adjointness:
adjoint_cdiffop(ham1,ham1_star);


adjoint_cdiffop(ham2,ham2_star);


ham1_star_sf(1)+sym1(1);


0

ham2_star_sf(1)+sym2(1);


0


% The last two commands must return 0.

% Defines the previously computed Hamiltonian operators,
% the user may check that they are the same as sym1(1) and sym2(1)
sym1_odd := {p_x};


sym1_odd := {p_x}

sym2_odd := {(1/3)*p*u_x + p_3x + (2/3)*p_x*u};


              p*u_x + 3*p_3x + 2*p_x*u
sym2_odd := {--------------------------}
                         3


% Converts the two operators to bivectors
conv_genfun2biv(sym1,biv1);


conv_genfun2biv(sym2,biv2);



% Computes the Schouten bracket of the operators;

schouten_bracket(biv1,biv1,sb11);


sb11(1);

schouten_bracket(biv1,biv2,sb12);


sb12(1);

schouten_bracket(biv2,biv2,sb22);
