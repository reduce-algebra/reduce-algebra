COMMENT This is lesson 4 of 7 REDUCE lessons.  As before, please
refrain from using variables beginning with the letters F through H
during the lesson.

In theory, assignments and LET statements are sufficient to accomplish
anything that any other practical computing mechanism is capable of
doing.  However, it is more convenient for some purposes to use
function procedures which can employ branch selection and iteration as
do most traditional programming languages.  As a trivial example, if
we invariably wanted to replace cotangents with the corresponding
tangents, we could input:;

algebraic procedure cotan(x); 1/tan(x);

COMMENT As an example of the use of this function, we have;

cotan(log(f));

pause;

COMMENT Note:

   1.  The procedure definition automatically declares the procedure
       name as an operator.
   2.  A procedure can be executed any time after its definition,
       until it is cleared.
   3.  Any parameters are dummy variables that are distinct from any
       other variables with the same name outside the procedure
       definition, and the corresponding arguments can be arbitrary
       expressions.
   4.  The value returned by a procedure is the value of the
       expression following the procedure statement.
   5.  The function COT is already defined in REDUCE and should not be
       redefined.

We can replace this definition with a different one:;

algebraic procedure cotan(y); cos(y)/sin(y);

g1 := cotan(log(f));

COMMENT In place of the word ALGEBRAIC, we can optionally use the word
INTEGER when a function always returns an integer value, or we can
optionally use the word REAL when a function always returns a
floating-point value.  (ALGEBRAIC can also be omitted, since it is the
default procedure type.)

Try writing a procedure definition for the sine in terms of the
cosine, then type G1.;

pause;

COMMENT Here is a more complicated function which introduces the
notion of a conditional expression:;

algebraic procedure sumcheck(aj, j, m, n, s);
   COMMENT J is an indeterminate and the other parameters are
      expressions.  This function returns the global variable named
      PROVED if the function can inductively verify that S equals the
      sum of AJ for J going from M through N, returning the global
      variable named UNPROVED otherwise.  For the best chance of
      proving a correct sum, the function should be executed under the
      influence of ON EXP, ON MCD, and any other user-supplied
      simplification rules relevant to the expression classes of AJ
      and S;
   if sub(j=m,aj) - sub(n=m,s) neq 0 or
      s + sub(j=n+1,aj) - sub(n=n+1,s) neq 0 then unproved
    else proved;

on exp, mcd;

clear x, j, n;

sumcheck(j, j, 1, n, n*(n+1)/2);

sumcheck(x^j, j, 0, n, (x^(n+1)-1)/(x-1));

COMMENT Within procedures of this sort a global variable is any
variable which is not one of the parameters, and a global variable has
the value, if any, which is current for that name at the point from
where the procedure is used.;

pause;

COMMENT Conditional expressions have the form

   IF condition THEN expression1 ELSE expression2.

There are generally several equivalent ways of writing a conditional
expression.  For example, the body of the above procedure could have
been written

   IF SUB(J=M,AJ) - SUB(N=M,S) = 0 AND
      S + SUB(J=N+1,AJ) - SUB(N=N+1,S) = 0 THEN PROVED
    ELSE UNPROVED.

Note how we compare a difference with 0, rather than comparing two
nonzero expressions, for reasons explained in lesson 3.

As an exercise, write a procedure analogous to SUMCHECK for proving
closed-form product formulas, then test it on the valid formula that
COS(N*X) equals the product of COS(J*X)/COS(J*X-X) for J ranging from
1 through N.  You do not need to include prefatory comments describing
parameters and the returned value until you learn how to use a text
editor.;

pause;

COMMENT Most REDUCE statements are also expressions because they have
a value.  The value is usually 0 if nothing else makes sense, but I
will mention the value only if it is useful.

The value of an assignment statement is the assigned value.  Thus a
multiple assignment, performed right to left, can be achieved by a
sequence of the form

    variable1 := variable2 := ... := variableN := expression.

Moreover, assignments can be inserted within ordinary expressions such
as X*(Y:=5).  Such assignments must usually be parenthesized because
of the low precedence of the assignment operator, and excessive use of
this construct tends to make programs confusing.;

pause;

COMMENT REDUCE treats as a single expression any sequence of
statements preceded by the pair of adjacent characters << and followed
by the pair >>.  The value of such a group expression is the value of
the last statement in the group.

Group expressions facilitate the implementation of tasks that are most
easily stated as a sequence of operations.  However, such sequences
often utilize temporary variables to count, hold intermediate results,
etc., and it is hazardous to use global variables for that purpose.
If a top-level REDUCE statement or another function directly or
indirectly uses that variable name, then its value or its virgin
indeterminate status there might be damaged by our use as a temporary
variable.  In large programs or programs which rely on the work of
others, such interference has a non-negligible probability, even if
all programmers agree to the convention that all such temporary
variables should begin with the function name as a prefix and all
programmers attempt to comply with the convention.  For this reason,
REDUCE provides another expression-valued sequence called a
BEGIN-block, which permits the declaration of local variables that are
distinct from any other variables outside the block having the same
name.  Another advantage of using local variables for temporary
variables is that the perhaps large amount of storage occupied by
their values can be reclaimed after leaving their block.;

pause;

COMMENT A BEGIN-block consists of the word BEGIN, followed by optional
declarations, followed by a sequence of statements, followed by the
word END.  Within BEGIN-blocks, it is often convenient to return
control and possibly a value from someplace other than the end of the
block.  Control and a value may be returned via a RETURN-statement of
the form

          RETURN expression
or
          RETURN,

0 being returned in the latter case.  A BEGIN-block does not return
the value of the last statement.  If a value is to be returned then
RETURN must be used.  These features and others are illustrated by the
following function:;

pause;

algebraic procedure limit(ex, indet, pnt);
   begin COMMENT This function uses up through 4 iterations of L'Hospital's
      rule to attempt determination of the limit of expression EX as
      indeterminate INDET approaches expression PNT.  This function is
      intended for the case where SUB(INDET=PNT, EX) yields 0/0,
      provoking a zero-divide message.  This function returns the
      global variable named UNDEFINED when the limit is 0 dividing an
      expression which did not simplify to 0, and this function
      returns the global variable named UNKNOWN when it cannot
      determine the limit.  Otherwise this function returns an
      expression which is the limit.  For best results, this function
      should be executed under the influence of ON EXP, ON MCD, and
      any user-supplied simplification rules appropriate to the
      expression classes of EX and PNT;
   integer iteration;
   scalar n, d, nlim, dlim;
   iteration := 0;
   n := num(ex);
   d := den(ex);
   nlim := sub(indet=pnt, n);
   dlim := sub(indet=pnt, d);
   while nlim=0 and dlim=0 and iteration<5 do <<
      n := df(n, indet);
      d := df(d, indet);
      nlim := sub(indet=pnt, n);
      dlim := sub(indet=pnt, d);
      iteration := iteration + 1 >>;
   return (if nlim=0 then
              if dlim=0 then unknown
              else 0
           else if dlim=0 then undefined
           else nlim/dlim)
   end;

% Examples follow...
pause;

g1 := (e^x-1)/x;

% Evaluation at 0 causes a zero denominator error at top level but
% continue anyway.
sub(x=0, g1);

limit(g1, x, 0);

g1:= ((1-x)/log(x))^2;

% Evaluation at 1 causes a zero denominator error at top level but
% continue anyway.
sub(x=1, g1);

limit(g1, x, 1);

COMMENT  Note:

   1.  The idea behind L'Hospital's rule is that as long as the
       numerator and denominator are both zero at the limit point, we
       can replace them by their derivatives without altering the
       limit of the quotient.
   2.  Assignments within groups and BEGIN-blocks do not automatically
       cause output.
   3.  Local variables are declared INTEGER, REAL, or SCALAR, the
       latter corresponding to the same most general class denoted by
       ALGEBRAIC in a procedure statement.  All local variables are
       initialized to zero, so they cannot serve as indeterminates.
       Moreover, if we attempted to overcome this by clearing them, we
       would clear all variables with their names.
   4.  We do not declare the attributes of parameters.
   5.  The NUM and DEN functions respectively extract the numerator
       and denominator of their arguments.  (With OFF MCD, the
       denominator of 1+1/X would be 1.)
   6.  The WHILE-loop has the general form

          WHILE condition DO statement.

       REDUCE also has a "GO TO" statement, and using commas rather
       than semicolons to prevent termination of this comment, the
       above general form of a WHILE-loop is equivalent to

          BEGIN  GO TO TEST,
       LOOP: statement,
       TEST: IF condition THEN GO TO LOOP,
          RETURN 0
          END.

       A GOTO statement is permitted only within a block, and the GOTO
       statement cannot refer to a label outside the same block or to
       a label inside a block that the GOTO statement is not also
       within.  Actually, 99.99% of REDUCE BEGIN-blocks are less
       confusing if written entirely without GOTOs, and I mention them
       primarily to explain WHILE-loops in terms of a more primitive
       notion.;

pause;

COMMENT
   7.  The LIMIT function provides a good illustration of nested
       conditional expressions.  Proceeding sequentially through such
       nests, each ELSE clause is matched with the nearest preceding
       unmatched THEN clause in the group or block.  In order to help
       reveal their structure, I have consistently indented nested
       conditional statements, continuations of multi-line statements
       and loop-bodies according to one of the many staunchly defended
       indentation styles.  (If you have an instructor, I also urge
       you to humor him by adopting his style for the duration of the
       course.)
   8.  C and Java programmers take note: "IF ... THEN ... ELSE ..." is
       regarded as one expression, and semicolons are used to separate
       rather than terminate statements.  Moreover, BEGIN and END are
       brackets rather than statements, so a semicolon is never needed
       immediately after BEGIN, and a semicolon is necessary
       immediately preceding END only if the END is intended as a
       labeled destination for a GOTO.  Within conditional
       expressions, an inappropriate semicolon after an END, a >>, or
       an ELSE-clause is likely to be one of your most prevalent
       mistakes.;

pause;

COMMENT The next exercise is based on the above LIMIT function:

For the sum of positive expressions AJ for J ranging from some finite
initial value to infinity, the infinite series converges if the limit
of the ratio SUB(J=J+1,AJ)/AJ is less than 1 as J approaches infinity.
The series diverges if this limit exceeds 1, and the test is
inconclusive if the limit is 1.  To convert the problem to the form
required by the above LIMIT program, we can replace J by 1/!*FOO in
the ratio, then take the limit as the indeterminate !*FOO approaches
zero.  (Since an indeterminate is necessary here, I picked the weird
name !*FOO to make the chance of conflict negligible.)

After writing such a function to perform the ratio test, test it on
the examples AJ=J/2^J, AJ=1/J^2, AJ=2^J/J^10, and AJ=1/J.  (The first
two converge and the second two diverge.);

pause;

COMMENT Groups or blocks can be used wherever any arbitrary expression
is allowed, including the right-hand side of a LET rule.

The need for loops with an integer index variable running from a given
initial value through a given final value by a given increment is so
prevalent that REDUCE offers a convenient special way of accomplishing
it via a FOR-loop, which has the general form

   FOR index := initial STEP increment UNTIL final DO statement.

Except for the use of commas as statement separators, this construct
is equivalent to

   BEGIN INTEGER index,
   index := initial,
   IF increment>0 THEN WHILE index <= final DO <<
      statement,
      index := index + increment >>
   ELSE WHILE index >= final DO <<
      statement,
      index := index + increment >>,
   RETURN 0
   END;

pause;

COMMENT Note:

   1.  The index variable is automatically declared local to the FOR-
       loop.
   2.  "initial", "increment", and "final" must have integer values.
   3.  FORTRAN programmers take note: the body of the loop is not
       automatically executed at least once.
   4.  An abbreviation for "STEP 1 UNTIL" is ":".
   5.  Since the WHILE-loop and the FOR-loop have implied BEGIN-
       blocks, a RETURN statement within their bodies cannot transfer
       control further than the point following the loops.

Another frequent need is to produce output from within a group or
block, because such output is not automatically produced.  This can be
done using the WRITE-statement, which has the form

   WRITE expression1, expression2, ..., expressionN.

Beginning a new line with expression1, the expressions are printed
immediately adjacent to each other, split over line boundaries if
necessary.  The value of the WRITE-statement is the value of its last
expression, and any of the expressions can be a character-string of
the form "character1 character2 ... characterM".

Inserting the word "WRITE" on a separate line before an assignment is
convenient for debugging, because the word is then easily deleted
afterward.  These features and others are illustrated by the following
equation solver:;

pause;

operator solvefor, soln;

for all x, lhs, rhs let solvefor(x, lhs, rhs) = solvefor(x, lhs-rhs);

COMMENT LHS and RHS are expressions such that P=NUM(LHS-RHS) is a
polynomial of degree at most 2 in the indeterminate or functional form
X.  Otherwise an error message is printed.  As a convenience, RHS can
be omitted if it is 0.  If P is quadratic in X, the two values of X
which satisfy P=0 are stored as the values of the functional forms
SOLN(1) and SOLN(2).  If P is a first-degree polynomial in X, SOLN(1)
is set to the one solution.  If P simplifies to 0, SOLN(1) is set to
the identifier ARBITRARY.  If P is an expression which does not
simplify to zero but does not contain X, SOLN(1) is set to the
identifier NONE.  In all other cases, SOLN(1) is set to the identifier
UNKNOWN.  The function then returns the number of SOLN forms which
were set.  This function prints a well deserved warning message if the
denominator of LHS-RHS contains X.  If LHS-RHS is not polynomial in X,
it is wise to execute this function under the influence of ON GCD.;

pause;

for all x, lhsmrhs let solvefor(x, lhsmrhs) =
   begin integer hipow;  scalar temp, cflist, cf0, cf1, cf2;
   if lhsmrhs = 0 then <<
      soln(1) := arbitrary;
      return 1 >>;
   cflist :=  coeff(lhsmrhs, x);
   hipow := hipow!*;
   if hipow = 0 then <<
      soln(1) := none;
      return 1 >>;
   if hipow > 2 then <<
      soln(1) := unknown;
      return 1 >>;
   if hipow = 1 then <<
      soln(1) := first(cflist)/second(cflist);
      if df(sub(x=!*foo, soln(1)), !*foo) neq 0 then
         soln(1) := unknown;
      return 1 >>;
   cf0 := first(cflist)/third(cflist);
   cf1 := -second(cflist)/third(cflist)/2;
   if df(sub(x=!*foo, cf0), !*foo) neq 0
         or df(sub(x=!*foo, cf1), !*foo) neq 0  then <<
      soln(1) := unknown;
      return 1 >>;
   temp := (cf1^2 - cf0)^(1/2);
   soln(1) := cf1 + temp;
   soln(2) := cf1 - temp;
   return 2
   end;

COMMENT And some examples:;

pause;

for k:=1:solvefor(x, a*x^2, -b*x-c) do write soln(k) := soln(k);

for k:=1:solvefor(log(x), 5*log(x)-7) do write soln(k) := soln(k);

for k:=1:solvefor(x, x, x) do write soln(k) := soln(k);

for k:= 1:solvefor(x, 5) do write soln(k) := soln(k);

for k:=1:solvefor(x, x^3+x+1) do write soln(k) := soln(k);

for k:=1:solvefor(x, x*e^x, 1) do write soln(k) := soln(k);

g1 := x/(e^x-1);

% Results in 'invalid as polynomial' error, continue anyway:;
for k:=1:solvefor(x, g1) do write soln(k) := soln(k);

sub(x=soln(1), g1);

limit(g1, x, soln(1));

pause;

COMMENT Here we have used LET rules to permit the user the convenience
of omitting default arguments.  (Function definitions have to have a
fixed number of parameters.)

Array elements are designated by the same syntax as matrix elements,
namely as functional forms having integer arguments.  Here are some
desiderata that may help you decide which of these alternatives is
most appropriate for a particular application:

   1.  The lower bound of each array subscript is 0 vs. 1 for
       matrices vs. unrestricted for functional forms.
   2.  The upper bound of each array subscript must have a specific
       integer value at the time the array is declared, as must the
       upper bounds of matrix subscripts when a matrix is first
       referred to, on the left side of a matrix assignment.  In
       contrast, functional forms never require a commitment to a
       specific upper bound.
   3.  An array can have any fixed number of subscripts, a matrix must
       have exactly 2, and a functional form can have a varying
       arbitrary number.
   4.  Matrix operations, such as transpose and inverse, are built-in
       only for matrices.
   5.  For most implementations, access to array elements requires
       time approximately proportional to the number of subscripts,
       whereas access to matrix elements takes time approximately
       proportional to the sum of the two subscript values, whereas
       access to functional forms takes average time approximately
       proportional to the number of bound functional forms having
       that name.
   6.  Only functional forms permit the effect of a subscripted
       indeterminate such as having an answer be "A(M,N) + B(3,4)".
   7.  Only functional forms can be used alone in the LHS of LET
       substitutions.;

pause;

COMMENT
   8.  All arrays, matrices, and operators are global regardless of
       where they are declared, so declaring them within a BEGIN-block
       does not afford the protection and automatic storage recovery
       of local variables.  Moreover, clearing them within a
       BEGIN-block will clear them globally, and normal functions
       cannot return an array or a matrix value.  Furthermore, REDUCE
       parameters are referenced by value, which means that an
       assignment to a parameter has no effect on the corresponding
       argument.  Thus, matrix or array results cannot be transmitted
       back to an argument either.

   9.  It is often advantageous to use two or more of these
       alternatives to represent a set of quantities at different
       times in the same program.  For example, to get the general
       form of the inverse of a 3-by-3 matrix, we could write

          MATRIX AA(3,3),
          OPERATOR A,
          FOR J:=1:3 DO
             FOR K:=1:3 DO AA(J,K) := A(J,K),
          AA^-1.

       As another example, we might use an array to receive some
       polynomial coefficients, then transfer the values to a matrix
       for inversion.;

pause;

COMMENT The COEFF function is the remaining new feature in our
SOLVEFOR example.  The first argument is a polynomial expression in
the indeterminate or functional form which is the second argument.
The polynomial coefficients of the integer powers of the indeterminate
are returned as a LIST, with the independent coefficient first.  The
highest and lowest non-zero powers are placed in the variables HIPOW!*
and LOWPOW!* respectively.

A LIST is a kind of data structure, just as matrices and arrays are.
It is represented as a comma-separated sequence of elements enclosed
in braces.  The elements can be accessed with the functions FIRST,
SECOND, THIRD, PART(i) which returns the i-th element, and REST, which
returns a list of all but the first element.  For example:;

clear x;

coeff(x^5+2, x);

lowpow!*;

hipow!*;

pause;

COMMENT COEFF does not check to make sure that the coefficients do not
contain its second argument within a functional form, so that is the
reason we differentiated.  The reason we first substituted the
indeterminate !*FOO for the second argument is that differentiation
does not work with respect to a functional form.

The last exercise is to rewrite the last rule so that we can solve
equations which simplify to the form

   a*x^(m+2*l) + b*x^(m+l) + c*x^m = 0,  where m >= 0 and l >= 1.

The solutions are

   0,  with multiplicity m,
   x1*E^(2*j*I*pi/l),
   x2*E^(2*j*I*pi/l),  with j = 0, 1, ..., l-1,

where x1 and x2 are the solutions to the quadratic equation

   a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0.

As a convenience to the user, you might also wish to have a global
switch named SOLVEPRINT, such that when it is nonzero, the solutions
are automatically printed.

This is the end of lesson 4.  When you are ready to run lesson 5,
start a new REDUCE session.
