I have updated and checked lessons 1 to 5 (so far).  They no longer
refer to obsolete hardware!

Francis Wright. May 2018


These interactive lessons are from David Stoutemyer and, as you will see from
the comments at the start of the first they date from when Reduce was run on
a DEC System 10 or System 20. That means that they are designed to be used
with versions of Reduce dating from the first half of the 1980s. They will
hence be out of date in various respects, and are NOT expected or guaranteed
even to work at all now. But perhaps somebody would like to review them,
check every step and all the results and perhaps extend the series with some
further lessons covering aspects of Reduce introduced over the last 20 years!
