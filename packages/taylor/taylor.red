%  This package implements a new data structure:
%
%            >>> the TAYLOR KERNEL <<<
%
%  and the functions necessary to operate on it.
%
%  A TAYLOR KERNEL is a kernel of the following form:
%
%   (Taylor!* TayCoeffList TayTemplate TayOrig TayFlags)
%
%   where:
%    Taylor!*        is a symbol identifying the kernel.
%    TayCoeffList    is a list of TayCoeff's.
%                    A TayCoeff is a pair
%                     (TayPowerList . StandardQuotient).
%                    A TayPowerList is a list of TayDegreeList's,
%                    each of which is a list of integers that
%                    denote the exponents of the Taylor variables.
%    TayTemplate     is a list of lists, each containing the three
%                    elements  TayVars, TayPoint, TayOrder,
%                    TayNextOrder, (being the list of variables, the
%                    expansion point the power of the variable in the
%                    last coefficient computed, and the power of the
%                    next coefficient, respectively)
%                    It is used as a template for the car of the
%                    pairs in a TayCoeffList.
%    TayOrig         is the original expression to be Taylor expanded,
%                    as a standard quotient. It is held mainly for
%                    the use by possible future extensions.
%                    This part is nil if the switch taylorkeeporiginal
%                    was off during expansion.
%    TayFlags        is currently unused and reserved for future
%                    extensions.

%
%       Revision history
%
%*****************************************************************
%
%
% 12-Sep-2022    2.4e
%
%   Add taylorcoefflist operator.
%
% 12-Apr-2022    2.4d
%
%   Taylortostandard didn't always convert a Taylor kernel to standard
%    prefix form, as the code in alg/prep.red doesn't call the prepfn2
%    in all possible cases. Rewrite the code to go through simp!*, resimp,
%    and simptaylor!* instead of prepsq.
%
%   Add protection when taylor!*print is called while defining a rule
%    for taylor!*.
%
% 12-Jan-2022    2.4c
%
%   Add interface function TayApplyOpfn for applying a symbolic operator
%    of one argument (e.g., an algebraic procedure to a Taylor kernel)
%    and TayApplyOpfn2 for applying a symbolic operator with an extra
%    fixed argument.
%
% 25-Sep-2021    2.4b
%
%   Do no longer remove shift rules for psi function during expansion.
%    This is no longer necessary as gamma, psi, and polygamma are handled
%    via their taylorsimpfn introduced in version 2.4.
%
% 01-Aug-2021    2.4a
%
%   Correct a case that may lead to non-unique kernels in the expansion
%    point and in expansion of Gamma, psi, and polygamma.
%
%   Make tracing output more readable.
%
% 22-May-2021    2.4
%
%   Add taylorsimpfn for Gamma, Psi, and Polygamma.
%    This allows expansion about the poles are the non-negative integers.
%
%   Fix a bug: substitution of a taylor variable by the coressponding
%    expansion point returned an incorrect result.
%
%   A bit of cleanup: add missing declarations of global or fluid variables,
%    remove unused local variables, update imports declarations.
%
%
% 19-May-2021    2.3a
%
%   Minor improvement of calculation of atan/atanh and friends:
%    Replace log(-1) by i*pi where appropriate.
%
% 30-Mar-2020    2.3
%   Changed interface to global mul!* variable:
%    Previously, every occurence of a Taylor kernel in simplication had
%    added taysimpsq to the mul!* variable. This led to an infinite recursion
%    if !*uncached was set to t.
%   Now the interface is via a new function taysimpsq!-from-mul that sets
%    a fluid taynomul!* to indicate that mul!* should not be modified in
%    inferior calls to simplification. This reduces run time slightly.
%
%
% 22-Jun-2018    2.2g
%   When a taylor series is computed via differentiation, the constant term is
%    evaluated by substituting the expansion point. Catch a possible error
%    (i.e. division by zero) at this point and call taylor!-error.
%   Modify taylor!-error to print the error message if the switch trtaylor is on.
%    This helps if taylor expansions are computed in an errorset where error
%    messages are not printed (i.e. when calling from the limit package).
%
% 05-Nov-2015    2.2f
%   Protect computation of implicit_taylor against error during substitution.
%   Corrected handling of singularities for dilog and Ei.
%   Improved printing when expansion point is on negative real axis.
%   First attempt at Taylor expansion of gamma function: removing shift rules
%    for psi function during expansion allows computation of gamma's Taylor series
%    via differentiation.
%
% 25-Jul-2014    2.2e
%   Set default value for switches.
%
% 06-Feb-2013    2.2d
%   Improved trace output.
%
%   Increased maximum number of restarts with higher order, for new example
%    from limit package. This uncovered a bug in taysimpasin and taysimpatan.
%
%   Added optimization for expansion of variable raised to rational power.
%
% 21-Aug-2010    2.2c
%   Create taylor's own fkern function, instead of manipulating
%   the klist!* directly.
%
% 08-Jun-2001    2.2b
%   Bind !*precise to nil in simptaylor, to avoid problems with SQRT
%    and ABS.
%
% 01-Apr-2000    2.2a
%   Corrected problem in taysimpasin, discovered by John Fitch.
%
% 18-Jun-1997    2.2
%   Added module TayPart, an interface to the PART operator.
%
%   Minor improvement in procedure taylorexpand!-samevar: do not signal
%    an error if we are content with the terms we got (i.e. third
%    argument flg is nil.
%
%
% 16-Apr-1997    2.1f
%   Slight improvement in tracing output (inline Taylor!-trace).
%   Avoid infinite recursion when mcd is off (pointed out by
%    Wolfram Koepf).
%
% 03-May-1995    2.1e
%   Corrected differentation of Taylor kernels if expansion point
%    depends on variable. (Integration still gives wrong result.)
%   Printing procedures did not always work for right hand side of
%    rules.
%
% 03-Apr-1995    2.1d
%   Removed special handling for constant Taylor series in taysimptan,
%    taysimpsin and taysimpsinh, as it didn't work when the function in
%    question has a pole and the expansion point.
%
% 09-Jan-1995    2.1c
%   Changed rules in tayfns.red to new ~~ format.
%
% 22-Jul-1994    2.1b
%   Corrected glitch in function common!-increment.
%
% 10-Jun-1994    2.1a
%   Corrected expansion of tan at pole up to order 0: make quottaylor
%    and invtaylor signal restartable error, have taylorexpand truncate
%    its result.
%   Operator expint is now called ei.
%   Changed error message in taysimpasin to signal a branch point, not
%    an essential singularity.
%
% 08-May-1994    2.1
%   Added implicit_taylor and inverse_taylor.
%
%

%   Added TayExp!-max2.
%   Rewrote expansion code for monomials to produce higher order terms.
%

%   Corrected generation of simple Taylor kernels when switch mcd is
%    off.
%   Added code to catch looping with increased order, introduced a
%    better error message.
%   Added a few missing parentheses in functions taysimpexpt and
%    tayrevert1.
%
% 03-Mar-1994    2.0
%   Introduced rational exponents for Puiseux series. This required
%    changes to various functions:
%      Taylor exponent manipulation functions
%      expttayrat
%      expttayrat!* (removed)
%      pos!-rat!-kern!-pow
%      smallest!-increment and common!-increment

%   Moved (nearly) all inlines into header (taylor) module,
%    made cst!-Taylor!* an inline, moved remaining functions from
%    taymacros into tayutils, deleted taymacros module.
%   Made makecoeffpairs (in module taybasic) from inline to expr.
%   Changed taylorsamevar to use TayOrig part of Taylor kernel if
%    present.
%   Changed Taylor printing functions since it is now possible to
%    pass information of operator precedence (via pprifn property).
%   Fixed bug in subsubtaylor (found by H. Melenk): did not substitute
%    in expansion point.
%   Changed error handling to call new function rerror instead of
%    rederr.
%   Changed for use of new hooks prepfn2, subfunc, and dfform
%    instead of redefining sqchk, subsublis, and diffp.
%
% 20-Oct-1990    1.2j
%   Added check in subsubtaylor for variable dependency.
%   Fixed stupid bug in taylorsamevar.
%   Corrected taysimpexpt to handle rational exponents with ON RATIONAL.
%   Corrected expttayrat: looks now at first NON-ZERO coefficient to
%    determine whether root can safely be computed.
%   Fixed bug in mult!.comp!.tp..
%   Added error check in invtaylor1 and quottaylor1.
%   Fixed bug in quottaylor1 that produced wrong results for
%    multidimensional Taylor series, introduced taydegree!-min2 and
%    taydegree!-strict!-less!-or!-equal!-p.
%
% 05-Oct-1990    1.2i
%   Replaced variable name nn by nm in taysimpsq to avoid name conflicts
%    with the SPDE package by Fritz Schwartz.
%   Replaced call to apply by apply1 in taysimpkernel.
%   Minor changes in expttayrat, taysimplog, taysimpexp, and taysimptan:
%    inserted explicit calls to invsq to allow negative numbers in
%    denominator.
%   Fixed bugs in difftaylorwrttayvar, inttaylorwrttayvar and
%    subsubtaylor: treatment of a Taylor kernel expanded about infinity
%    would give a wrong result.  Found by John Stewart.
%
% 11-Aug-1990    1.2h
%   Replaced call to get!* by get in diffp since get!* will no longer
%    be available in REDUCE 3.4.
%   Fixed bug in multintocoefflist that was introduced by replacing
%    car by TayCfPl.
%   Moved setting of TayOrig part from taylor1 to taylorexpand.  This
%    avoids Taylor kernels in the TayOrig part of multidimensional
%    Taylor expansions.  It does not fully solve the problem since
%    they can still be generated by applying the Taylor operator to
%    expressions that do not contain fully Taylor-combined Taylor
%    kernels.
%   Reversed list of expansions in call to taylorexpand in simptaylor.
%    Modified taylor1 accordingly.  Previously this could trigger a
%    `This can't happen' error message (due to incorrect ordering of
%    the Taylor variables).
%   Removed procedures delete!-coeff and replace!-coeff since they are
%    no longer used.
%   Moved call to subs2 out of differentiation loop in taylor2f,
%    improves timing significantly; deleted superfluous declared
%    integer variable.
%   Fixed bug in taylorsamevar.
%   Added extra checks and double evaluation of lists in simptaylor.
%   Replaced a number of ./ by !*f2q, introduced some !*n2f conversion
%    functions.
%   Development frozen, version shipped out.
%
% 06-May-1990    1.2g
%   Fixed bug in taylor2e that caused order of kernels in homogenous
%    expansions to be reverted.  Discovered by Karin Gatermann.
%   Removed binomial!-coeff since no longer needed (in expttayrat).
%   Replaced some forgotten car/cdr by TayCfPl/TayCfSq.
%   Reordered import declarations.
%   Replaced many semicolons by dollar signs.  Decreases amount of
%    printing during input of this file.
%   Minor bug fix in taysimpsin.
%   Minor change in taysimpasin and taysimpatan.
%   Split inttaylorwrttayvar into two procedures, added check for
%    logarithmic term in integration procedure inttaylorwrttayvar1.
%   Replaced combination of addsq and negsq by subtrsq in quottaylor1,
%    subsubtaylor and taysimplog.
%   Renamed taygetcoeff to TayGetCoeff (doesn't make any difference
%    on case-insensitive systems).
%   Minor changes in taymultcoeffs, multintocoefflist, resimptaylor,
%    taylor1sq, taylor2f, negtaylor1, quottaylor1, invtaylor1,
%    expttayrat, subsubtaylor, difftaylor, taysimpasin, taysimpatan,
%    taysimplog, taysimpexp, taysimptan, difftaylorwrttayvar,
%    inttaylorwrttayvar1, addtaylor1 (cons -> TayMakeCoeff).
%   Similar change in taysimpp (cons -> .**, i.e. to).
%
% 29-Mar-1990    1.2f
%   Fixed bug in taysimpf (addition of Taylor kernels) that could cause
%    "This can't happen" message.
%   Fixed bug in difftaylorwrttayvar: arguments to make!-cst!-coefflis
%    were interchanged.
%   Fixed similar bug in expttayrat (this procedure was never used!)
%   Added forgotten call to list in taylor2f.
%   Changed representation of big-O notation: print O(x^3,y^3) instead
%    of O(x^3*y^3) if expansion was done up to x^2*y^2.
%   Introduced new version of expttayrat (algorithm as quoted by Knuth)
%    which is faster by about a factor of two.
%   Fixed Taylor!-gen!-big!-O so that expansion point at infinity
%    is treated correctly for homogeneously expanded series.
%
% 27-Feb-1990    1.2e
%   Removed procedures addlogcoeffs, addexpcoeffs and addtancoeffs,
%    inserted code directly into taysimplog, taysimpexp, and
%    taysimptan.
%   taylorvars renamed to TayVars.
%   find!-non!-zero moved into Taylor!:macros module.
%
% 26-Feb-1990    1.2d
%   Added following selector, constructor, and modification inlines:
%    TayCfPl, TayCfSq, TayMakeCoeff, set!-TayCfPl, set!-TayCfSq,
%    TayTpElVars, TayTpElPoint, TayTpElOrder.
%   Some minor changes in several procedures to improve readability.
%
% 19-Jan-1990    1.2c
%   Removed first argument of addtaylor since never used.
%
% 14-Nov-1989    1.2b
%   Added taysimpsin.
%   Split tayinpoly1 off from tayinpoly, modified expttayrat
%    accordingly.
%   Changed global declarations to fluid.  No reason to prevent
%    binding.
%
% 11-Nov-1989    1.2a
%   Minor changes in the procedures changed yesterday (cleanup).
%   Added procedure taysimptan.
%   Replaced taylor1sq by taylorexpand in taysimpf1.
%   taysimpsq partly rewritten (will these bugs never die out?)
%   taysimpf1 renamed to taysimpf, taylor!*!-sf!-p to
%    Taylor!-kernel!-sf!-p.
%   Replaced a few of these by Taylor!-kernel!-sq!-p.
%
% 10-Nov-1989    1.2
%   Introduced taylorexpand to be the heart of simptaylor and to
%    replace simptaylor in taysimpt and multpowerintotaylor.
%   Added new versions of procedures taysimplog and taysimpexp
%    (Knuth's algorithm).
%   Taylor!:basic module moved up (so that some inlines are
%    defined earlier).
%
%
% 09-Nov-1989    1.1b
%   Fixed bug in taylor2e: quottaylor1 got the wrong template so
%    that it would truncate the resulting coeff list.
%   Added call to subs2 after call to diffsq in taylor2f so that
%    expressions containing radicals are simplified already at
%    this point.
%
% 21-Aug-1989    1.1a
%   Fixed bug in taysimpp: it could return a s.q. instead of a s.f.
%   Added a few forgotten import declarations.
%
% 31-Jul-1989    1.1
%   Slight changes in calls to confusion, minor change in taysimpp.
%   Introduced big-O notation, added taylorprintorder switch.
%   taysimpasin and taysimpatan now also calculate the inverse
%    hyperbolic functions.
%   New inline Taylor!-kernel!-sq!-p replaces combinations of
%    kernp and Taylor!*p.
%
%
% 24-Jul-1989    1.0a
%   Bug fix in constant!-sq!-p: mvar applied to s.q., not s.f.
%   Added safety check in taysimpt.
%
% 27-May-1989    1.0
%   Decided to call this version 1.0, it seems to be sufficiently (?)
%    bug free to do so.
%   Minor bug fix in expttayrat (forgotten variable declaration).
%
%
% 25-May-1989    0.9l
%   Bug fixed in taylor2e
%    (thanx to Rich Winkel from UMC for pointing out this one).
%   Cleaned up the code for truncating when combining Taylor kernels
%    of different order.
%   Introduced taysimpasin for computing the asin, acos, etc.
%    of a Taylor kernel.
%   Changed some internal procedures to call addtaylor1, etc.
%    instead of addtaylor, etc. if both arguments have the same
%    template.
%   Changed representation of the coefflist: expansion with respect
%    to one variable is a special case of homogeneous expansion.
%    This is now reflected in the internal representation.  These
%    changes make the code shorter since all expansions are
%    done the same way (fewer checks necessary).
%
% 23-Mar-1989    0.9k
%   Numerous bug fixes.
%   Changed subsubtaylor to allow error checking in var!-is!-nth.
%   Rewrote taydegree!-lessp to iterate over its arguments rather
%    than call itself recursively.
%   Introduced exceeds!-order instead of taydegree!-lessp
%    (in truncate!-coefflist and multtaylor1).
%   Minor changes in Taylor!*!-sf!-p, taysimpexp, var!-is!-nth,
%    taysimpexpt, and inttaylorwrttayvar.
%   Changed simptaylor!* to apply resimp to all coefficients and
%    to the tayorig part.
%   Changed subsubtaylor to allow substitution of a kernel into a
%    homogeneously expanded expression.
%   Changed difftaylorwrttayvar to allow differentiation of
%    homogeneously expanded expressions.
%   Changed subsubtaylor so that substitution of a kernel is possible
%    (not only a variable).
%   New constructor inlines make!-Taylor!* and TayFlagsCombine replace
%    explicit list building.
%   New procedures: get!-degree and truncate!-coefflist induced
%    changes in addtaylor/multtaylor/quottaylor/invtaylor.
%    This fixes the other problem pointed out by H. Melenk.
%   Split addtaylor/multtaylor the same way as quottaylor/invtaylor.
%   Introduced taylorautocombine switch and interface to simp!*
%    (via mul!* list).
%   Added symbolic; statement in taylor!-intro module; necessary
%    until module/endmodule are fixed to work together with faslout.
%   Changed subsubtaylor to return a conventional prefix form
%    if all Taylor variables are substituted by constants.
%   Changed difftaylorwrttayvar to ensure that the coefflist of
%    the Taylor kernel it returns is not empty.
%   Changed subsubtaylor to avoid 0**n for n<=0 when substituting
%    a Taylor variable (to signal an error instead);  changed
%    taylor!-error accordingly.
%   Added taylortemplate operator, removed inline
%    taylor!-map!-over!-coefficients.
%   Added code for expansion about infinity.
%   Split quottaylor into two parts: the driver (quottaylor) and
%    the routine doing the work (quottaylor1).  Same for invtaylor.
%   Rewrote the expansion procedures taylor1, taylor2,...
%   Change in taylor2e: added flg parameter, introduced
%    delete!-superfluous!-coeffs.
%   Added set!-tayorig and multintocoefflist.
%   Replaced simp by simp!* for simplication of tayorig part in
%    taysimplog and taysimpexpt.
%   Removed taysimpsq in taylorseriesp: it now returns t iff its
%    argument is a Taylor kernel disguised as a standard quotient.
%   Added taylororiginal operator.
%   Added a number of tests if tayorig of a Taylor kernel is non-nil
%    if !*taylorkeeporiginal is set.
%   Replaced calls to simpdiff in taylor2e and simpexpt by a call
%    to simp.
%   Minor change in taylor!*print!*1.
%   H. Melenk discovered that the code did not behave as documented:
%    addition of Taylor kernels differing only in their order did not
%    work, and Taylor expansion of a Taylor kernel w.r.t. one of its
%    variables would fail.
%    Corrected the latter problem by changing the substitution code
%    to allow a Taylor variable to be replaced by a constant.
%   taylorseriesp is now a boolean operator and therefore only
%    usable in if statements.
%   Replaced calls to subsq1/subf1 by subsq/subf,
%    definitions of subsq1 and taymaxdegree deleted.
%   Minor changes in taylor2hom and taylor2e.
%
% 28-Nov-1988    0.9j
%   Changed printing of `. . . ' to `...'.
%   Changed simptrig to simp in taysimpatan.
%   Changed simptaylor to simplify all its arguments, not only
%    the first one.
%   Added !*verboseload switch to conditionalize printing of
%    loading info.
%   Changed taylor2 to call taylor!-error instead of rederr.
%    Modified taylor!-error accordingly.
%
% 16-Nov-1988    0.9i
%   Fixed a Typo in quottaylor.
%   Inserted module/endmodule declarations.
%   Added errorset in taylor2 to catch zero denominators, etc.,
%    caused by expansion about essential singularities.
%
% 10-Nov-1988    0.9h
%   Fixed bugs that caused taking car of an atom (found by A.C.Hearn).
%    taysimpt used multf instead of multpf.
%    I also discovered a car/cdr of nil in
%    makecoeffpairs1/makecoeffpairshom1.
%    Reason: (nil . nil) == (nil), but what I want is
%    ((nil . nil)) == ((nil)).  Stupid, eh?
%
% 23-Jul-1988    0.9g
%   Added dmode!* to list of fluid variables,
%    removed taylor!-map!-over!-coefficients!-and!-orig.
%
% 26-May-1988    0.9f
%   Minor bug fix in taydegree!-lessp.
%
% 25-May-1988    0.9e
%   Fixed a number of smaller bugs.
%   Finally implemented multiplication and division for
%    homogeneously expanded Taylor series.
%   Today I realized that the procedure diffp in ALG2 had
%    been changed for REDUCE 3.3.
%
% 21-May-1988    0.9d
%   Fixed bug in invtaylor.
%   Rewrote quottaylor to do direct division rather use invtaylor.
%
% 14-May-1988    0.9c
%   Fixed substitution for expansion variable.
%
% 11-May-1988    0.9b
%   Fixed user interface functions taylorseriesp and taylortostandard.
%
% 10-May-1988    0.9a
%   Small changes in subsubtaylor and difftaylor to make the code
%    compilable, plus minor bug fixes.
%
% 08-May-1988    0.9
%    invtaylor changed to allow inversion of multidimensional
%     Taylor kernels (but still not for homogeneous expansion).
%
%
% 06-May-1988    0.8i
%   `conc' changed to `join' (for mnemonic purposes).
%
% 29-Apr-1988    0.8h
%   Minor bug fix in invtaylor (missing quote).
%
% 21-Mar-1988    0.8g
%   Minor change in TayDegreeSum.
%
% 17-Jan-1988    0.8f
%   Started implementation of homogeneous expansion
%    (required change in conversion to prefix form).
%
% 16-Jan-1988    0.8e
%   Minor change in the definition of confusion.
%
% 15-Jan-1988    0.8d
%   Changed to conform to REDUCE 3.3
%    (SWITCH statement, minor changes in parsing).
%
% 03-Jan-1988    0.8c
%   First version that is supposed to return always a correct result
%    (but not all possible cases are handled).
%
%
%*****************************************************************
%
%       Things to do:
%
%*****************************************************************
%
%     a) Finish implementation of homogeneous expansion (hard).
%     b) Find a method to handle singularities (very hard).
%     c) Perhaps I should change the definition of ORDP to order
%         Taylor kernels in some special way?
%     d) A better interface for the PART operator is desirable, e.g.
%         where the whole argument list to PART is passed to some
%         function.
%        It is not possible to interface to COEFF and COEFFN with
%         redefining the functions in the REDUCE kernel.
%     e) Rewrite the expansion code to recursively descend a standard
%         form.  This allows recognition of certain special functions,
%         e.g., roots and logarithms.  (Much work, requires rewriting
%         of a large part of the code.)
%     f) With e) it is easy to implement a DEFTAYLOR operator so that
%         the user may define the Taylor expansion of an unknown
%         function.
%     g) This would also allow the use of Taylor for power series
%         solutions of ODEs.
%     h) Implement a sort of lazy evaluation scheme, similar to the
%         one used in the TPS package written by Alan Barnes and
%         Julian Padget.  This would allow the calculation of more
%         terms of a series when they are needed.
%     i) Replace all non-id kernels that are independent of the Taylor
%         variables by gensyms.  This would reduce the size of the
%         expressions.

COMMENT This package has six switches:
        `TAYLORKEEPORIGINAL' causes the expression for which the
        expansion is performed to be kept.
        `TAYLORAUTOEXPAND' makes Taylor expressions ``contagious''
        in the sense that all other terms are automatically
        Taylor expanded and combined.
        `TAYLORAUTOCOMBINE' causes taysimpsq to be applied to all
        expressions containing Taylor kernels.  This is equivalent
        to applying `TAYLORCOMBINE' to all those expressions.
        If `TAYLORPRINTORDER' is set to ON Taylor kernels are
        printed in big-O notation instead of just printing three dots.
        `TRTAYLOR', if on, prints some information about the expansion
        process.
        `VERBOSELOAD' is a variable used by Portable Standard Lisp
        and causes a loading info to be printed;
