%
%     <sumvar>    summation variable                  (a kernel)
%     <lowlim>    lower limit of summation            (an integer)
%     <coeff>     general coefficient of power series (algebraic)
%     <depvar>    expansion variable of series        (a kernel)
%     <about>     expansion point of series           (algebraic)
%     <power>     general exponent of power series    (algebraic)

%     <power> must be a strictly increasing function of <sumvar>
%         this is now partially checked by the system
