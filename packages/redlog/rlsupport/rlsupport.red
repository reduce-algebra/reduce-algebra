% This package collects code which for technical reasons must be compiled before
% the compilation of the Redlog main package in redlog/rl. Otherwise, I would
% love to have all the modules here as modules of the package redlog. A
% technically feasible alternative solution would be to place (relevant parts)
% of that code into the main module redlog/rl/redlog.red. However, from my point
% of view this breaks modularization and would make the entire architecture
% harder to understand for others.
%
% In fact, I believe that there is a problem in Reduce that modules are
% essentially sections of packages but not units that are independent w.r.t.

% rl_service in rl/rlservices.red. As a consequence, rl_servicewrapper has to
% trigger an autoload to this package in support/entry.red. Hence, we feel we
% should export it here. This is a actually subtility about the semantics of
% the exports statement to be clarified at some point.
