Abstract :

This package contains algorithms for computations in commutative
algebra closely related to the Groebner algorithm for ideals and
modules. There are facilities for local computations, using a modern
implementation of Mora's standard basis algorithm, that works for
arbitrary term orders. This reflects the full analogy between modules
over local rings and homogeneous (in fact H-local) modules over
polynomial rings.

CALI extends also the term order facilities of the REDUCE internal
groebner package, defining term orders by degree vector lists, and
the rigid implementation of the sugar idea, by a more flexible ecart
vector, in particular useful for local computations. Version 2.2. has
also a common view on normal forms for noetherian and non-noetherian
term orders.

The package was designed mainly as a symbolic mode programming
environment extending the build-in facilities of REDUCE for the
computational approach to problems arising naturally in commutative
algebra. An algebraic mode interface allows to access (in a more
rigid frame) all important features implemented symbolically.

As main topics CALI contains facilities for

-- defining rings, ideals and modules,

-- computing Groebner bases and local standard bases,

-- computing syzygies, resolutions and (graded) Betti numbers,

-- computing (also weighted) Hilbert series, multiplicities,
        independent sets, dimensions,

-- computing normal forms and representations,

-- computing sums, products, intersections, elimination ideals etc.,

-- primality tests, computation of radicals, unmixed radicals,
        equidimensional parts, primary decompositions etc. of ideals
        and modules,

-- advanced applications of Groebner bases (blowup, associated graded
        ring, analytic spread, symmetric algebra, monomial curves),

-- applications of linear algebra techniques to zerodimensional
        ideals, as e.g. the FGLM change of term orders, border bases
        and affine and projective ideals of sets of points,

-- splitting polynomial systems of equations mixing factorization and
        Groebner algorithm, triangular systems, and different versions
        of the extended Groebner factorizer.

Reduce version required :

The program was tested under v. 3.4 - 3.6.
(I had some trouble with the module dualbases under 3.4.1)

Relevant publications :

See the bibliography in the manual.


Key words :

Groebner algorithm for ideals and modules, local standard bases,
Groebner factorizer, extended Groebner factorizer, triangular systems,
normal forms, ideal and module operations, Hilbert series, independent
sets, dual bases, border bases, affine and projective sets of points,
free resolution, constructive commutative algebra, primality test,
radical, unmixed radical, equidimensional part, primary decomposition,
blowup, associated graded ring, analytic spread, symmetric algebra,
monomial curves.



To be done :

eo(vars) : test cali!=basering for eliminationorder according to vars
        -> eliminate

Remind :

Never "put" variables, that are subject to rebounding via "where" !
