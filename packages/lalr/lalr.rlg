% Test cases for the parser generator. This all runs in symbolic mode...


%
% This is where (for now) I will put documentation of the syntax I
% will use when creating a grammer. There is a main function called
% lalr_create_parser and that is passed a list that describes
% a grammar. It is in the form of a sequence of productions, and the first
% one given is taken to be the top-level target.
%
% Each production is in the form
%     (LHS   ((rhs1.1 rhs1.2 ...) a1.1 a1.2 ...)
%            ((rhs2.1 rhs2.1 ...) a2.1 a2.2 ...)
%            ...)
% which in regular publication style for grammars might be interpreted
% as meaning
%      LHS ::= rhs1.1 rhs1.2 ... { a1.1 a1.2 ... }
%          |   rhs2.1 rhs2.2 ... { a2.1 a2.2 ... }
%          ...
%          ;
%
% Each LHS is treated as a non-terminal symbol and is specified as a simple
% name. Note that by default the Reduce parser will be folding characters
% within names to lower case and so it will be best to choose names for
% non-terminals that are unambiguous even when case-folded, but I would like
% to establish a convention that in source code they are written in capitals.
%
% The RHS items may be either non-terminals (identified because they are
% present in the left hand side of some production) or terminals. Terminal
% symbols can be specified in two different ways.
%
% Semantic actions must be given in Lisp, and the variables !$1, !$2, ...
% refer to the components from the matched right hand side. The final
% item in the semantic action is used as the result (and hence gets built
% up into the parse tree). If an explicit action is not given the
% behaviour is as if "(list !$1 !$2 ... !$n)" had been given, where the
% number of items is the number of terms in the pattern -- with a special
% case if there is only one item in which case the implicit action is
% just "!$1".
%
% The default lexer has built-in recipies that decode certain sequences
% of characters and return the special markers for !:symbol, !:number,
% !:string, !:list for commonly used cases. In these cases the variable
% yylval gets left set to associated data, so for instance in the case of
% !:symbol it gets set to the particular symbol concerned.
% The token type :list is used for Lisp or rlisp-like notation where the
% input contains
%     'expression
% or  `expression
% so for instance the input `(a b c) leads to the lexer returning !:list and
% yylvel being set to (backquote (a b c)). This treatment is specialised for
% handling rlisp-like syntax.
%
% Other terminals are indicated by writing a string. That may either
% consist of characters that would otherwise form a symbol (ie a letter
% followed by letters, digits and underscores) or a sequence of
% non-alphanumeric characters. In the latter case if a sequence of three or
% more punctuation marks make up a terminal then all the shorter prefixes
% of it will also be grouped to form single entities. So if "<-->" is a
% terminal then '<', '<-' and '<--' will each by parsed as single tokens, and
% any of them that are not used as terminals will be classified as !:symbol.
%
% A non-default lexer needs to be hand-written and can be installed
% for a grammar by using "set!-lexer". See examples.
%
% As well as terminals and non-terminals (which are written as symbols or
% strings) it is possible to write one of
%     (OPT s1 s2 ...)           0 or 1 instances of the sequence s1, ...
%     (STAR s1 s2 ...)          0, 1, 2, ... instances
%     (PLUS s1 s2 ...)          1, 2, 3, ... instances
%     (LIST sep s1 s2 ...)      like (STAR s1 s2 ...) but with the single
%                               item sep between each instance.
%     (LISTPLUS sep s1 ...)     like (PLUS s2 ...) but with sep interleaved.
%     (OR s1 s2 ...)            one or other of the tokens shown.
%
% When the lexer processes input it will return a numeric code that identifies
% the type of the item seen, so in a production one might write
%     (!:symbol ":=" EXPRESSION)
% and as it recognises the first two tokens the lexer will return a numeric
% code for !:symbol (and set yylval to the actual symbol as seen) and then
% a numeric code that it allocates for ":=". In the latter case it will
% also set yylval to the symbol !:!= in case that is useful.
%
% Precedence can be set using lalr_precedence. See examples lower down in this
% file.

% Some of the limitations are:
% (0) Testing has been pretty minimal so far, with the examples in this
%     file the main ones used. Well testing is ongoing with a grammar
%     for SML, and so things are improving on that front.
% (1) The lexer is hand-written and hence somewhat inflexible. It does
%     provide a set of option that can be used to tune it for (broad)
%     compatibility with several commonly-used languages. Probably some
%     people would appreciate something like "lex" or "flex" to make
%     lexer generationm automatic?
% (2) The issue of when input should end is not properly though through,
%     and so it is easy to end up with a syntax error reported when the
%     parser reaches what you had wanted to be the end of your input.
% (3) Diagnostics if you give a malformed grammar are weak.
% (4) The input format is perhaps crude, and in particular semantic actions
%     have to be given as raw Lisp code.
% (5) Diagnostics when you present malformed input to the parser are
%     not that good either...
% (6) The internals of the code use association lists and I *believe* that
%     calls to assoc, rassoc and related functions represent bottlenecks
%     such that processing could be made somewhat faster.
%
% I have listed the above in the order that I think I need to work on them.

% Here I set up a sample grammar

%    S  -> C C        { }

% This is example 4.42 from Aho, Sethi and Ullman's Red Dragon book.
% It is example 4.54 in the more recent Purple book.

% Note that this grammar will introduce "c" and "d" as keywords rather than
% being general symbols. When I construct a subsequent grammar that will
% undo that setting. I will omit semantic actions here so that the default
% action of building a form of tree is used.

% There seems to be an issue here in that if I use a name for a non-terminal
% that is the same as one used for a terminal thinsg get confused. So I had
% originally hoped and expected to write just 'c' for the name of the
% non-terminal here are use '"c"' to denote the terminal. However when I
% try that I find that internally the names and up clashing to rather bad
% effect. I will look into this later since it is merely a matter of surface
% notation!  Also in the input to semantic actions the values passed when a
% terminal is matched may at present be the internal numeric code allocated
% to that terminal, not a "sensible" value. Agian this is a small issue.

% The grammar shown here used to fail for lack of space. It should now
% behave.
% One issue it reveals at right now is that the processing here does not
% keep the types of terminal symbols under control carefully enough, so the
% numeric values 22 and 33 in the sample text get transliterated back into
% terminal symbols that happen to have ended up allocated numeric codes
% 22 and 33. This NEEDS fixing, but is not really an issue for the
% code that manufactures parsing tables.
