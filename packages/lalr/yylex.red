module 'yylex;

%
% This is a lexical anaylser for use with the LALR parser generator.
% By default it will handle items in the way that Rlisp does. Its interface
% is styled after the one needed by yacc, in that it exports a function
% called yylex() that returns as a value a category code, but
% sets a variable yylval to details associated with the item
% just parsed. The result will be an integer corresponding to a token
% type. By setting a flag I may change the lexical rules to match some
% other language.
%
% The variations listed here are so I can collect my thoughts about what
% options might plausibly arise. However having a fully general scheme
% would need to await implementation of something like "lex" or "flex" and
% that is overkill for the present!

%
% I propose to ignore comments introduced by words, and assume that
% placement on the line is not special, so that comments will be
% recognised either at the start of a line or anywhere within.
% This leaves the following cases
% (.) A single character starts a comment, which then runs to
%     the end of the line. (1), (6), (7).
% (.) a pair of characters (not necessarily the same) start a comment
%     that runs to end of line. (4), (8).
% (.) A pair of characters open a comment and a different pair end it,
%     with no nexting permitted. (3).
% (.) As above but comments do nest. (5).
% A grammar should be allowed to support one style of line comment and
% one of multiline comment, but I think that having more choices beyond that
% would feel excessive. Note the acronym YAGNI for "You ain't gonna need it"
% applies! But in summary the reasonable generality would need:
%    0, 1 or 2 characters that indicate line comments. If none then
%        there are no line comments. If 1 then line comments are introduced
%        by that character. If 2 they start with the character pair.
%    a flag and 2 or 4 characters for block comments. The flag indicates
%        whether nesting is supported. Well I suppose it should be
%        (1 or 2) plus (1 or 2) characters since start or end could perhaps
%        independently be either single characters or pairs.
%
%
% NAMES
%
% Basic names will start with a letter and continue with letters or
% digits.
%
% The key options are:
% (1) Are not-letters permitted at the start or within a name? For instance
%     Reduce allows "_" within a name but not as the first character. SML
%     allows quote marks but treats a name differently if the first character
%     is one. Common Lisp makes its lexer programmble, but by default it
%     will count !, $, %, &, +, -, *, /, @ and more as alphabetic, with
%     ", #, ', |, parentheses and comma perhaps having special status.
%     So I probably need a way to mark which characters can start a symbol
%     and which can continue it. SML also allows operator-like names, so I
%     also need a second pair of character-sets to support that. Rlisp
%     uses (!) as a character to escape something, while other languages
%     use (\). TeX allows a name to start with (\) but does not allow that
%     character within names.
%     Common Lisp allows names to be written as "|any chars|" and may
%     have special treatment of ":" within names: I will not support those
%     options. Sor SML I allow dots within names (so they are "long
%     identifiers". I do not at this stage provide any hooks to link those
%     into the module system.
%
% (2) Strings will be in (") marks, but there is an issue about escapes.
%     Many languages allow (\) escapes within strings and the exact rules
%     can be messy. But if that is what is provided I think I should
%     merely accept that the character after a (\) is treated as a generic
%     character and is not special even if it is (\) or ("). This means
%     that the (Lisp) string that I build will have the backslash present,
%     so in some cases a layer of past-lexing translation will be needed
%     to interpret escapes.
%
% (3) Character literals may be like string literals but with single
%     quotes?
%
%
% NUMBERS
%
% I intend (at least at present) to take a simple view that numbers are
% written in a naive simple way. That means that (at present) I will not
% support suffix notation such as "1LL". Floating point may only use
% the letter (E) or (e) as an exponent marker. I am certainly not going to
% play games with Common Lisp "potential numbers"! But I do allow hex
% numbers wioth 0xDDDD. For SML I make a prefix "~" for negation part of
% the numeric token, but I do not support "word" values as in 0xDDDD. There
% is no octal input, so numbers that start with a zero are not handled in any
% special magic manner, and 077 means 77 (decimal) not 63 (decimal).
%

% (R)LISP SPECIALS
%
% For Rlisp/Lisp I want (') to act as a read-macro that leads to the
% parsing of an s-expression! (`), (,) and (,@) are also introduce or
% are accepted within s-expressions in a way that it is hoped will feel
% reasonable to Lisp users.
%
%
% PREPROCESSING
%
% I can support the RLISP version of #if, #define and #eval.
%
% In the face of all this I will simplify and support just a small menu
% of regimes:
%  RLISP: Very specialist as far as the outside world is concerned, but
%         given that this is part of REDUCE it makes sense. The main features
%         are "!" as an escape character, "'" to introduce quoted expressions
%         "%" for comments and "#if" for conditional inclusion.
%  C/C++: Both "/*..*/" and "//" comments with broadly C-like rules for
%         names and strings. I do not support preprocessor directives at all
%         because the version of #if that I could support is not quite
%         comfortably C-like enough. I could presumably upgrade that to come
%         close to having a full C pre-processor if I really needed to.
%  SML:   Provided because I happen to have some SML that I wish to process.
%         "(*..*)" nesting comments and sequences of operator-characters
%         making up a single token are characteristic. Identifiers can be
%         built from punctuation sequences such as |==|, and names can have
%         embedded dots, as in "package_part.detail_part". No special
%         interpretation of the dots is done here. There is special
%         treatment for type names. A symbol can start with a (') and is then
%         classed as a type-name not a name, and other symbols can be
%         manually markes as type identifiers (eg words like "int" and "list"
%         will be).
%  Simple: For simple scripting I will provide a lexical scheme where "#"
%         introduces a comment and syntax is otherwise rather C-like.
%  TeX:   No strings, and names can be things lile "\begin" and "\(".
%
% I think that if I support just these (to start with) I should cover the
% needs I have for now! In all cases reserved words and reserved sequences
% of punctuation can emerge from the grammar, so of the grammar contains
% a rule with ":=" or "begin" in it then those strings will be recognized
% and treated specially.

% Before using this lexer all the special tokens that it must handle
% must be passed to it. These are passed as strings. Some of these
% will be purely made up out of letters and would otherwise be treated
% a "symbols" but when advised about them the code here will allocate
% a category code and treat them as keywords. Thus one might have
%     lex_keywords '("if" "else" "begin" "end");
% These cases do not have any effect on how the lexer groups characters
% to form tokens, but do alter the result it gives in the cases concerned.
% Note that in RLISP an exclamation mark escapes the following character
% so it can appear in a symbol. A name written with one or more exclamation
% marks will never be treated as a keyword, and so even if the input 'begin'
% is special any of the inputs '!begin', 'b!egin' or '!b!e!g!i!n' (and of
% course many other variants) just yield a symbol.
%
% The second case is of keyword made up from punctuation marks. It is
% required (at least to start with) that keywords are either entirely
% alphanumeric or entirely punctuation. If no keywords have been set up then
% punctuation characters form single-character symbols. Thus for instance
% the input 'a:=b' would tokenise as a sequence of four symbols, 'a', ':',
% '=' and 'b'. If a multi-characters string has been passed to lex_keywords
% then dipthongs can be formed, so after
%     lex_keywords '(":=");
% the same input would tokenise to 3 items, the symbols 'a', a keyword ':='
% and then the symbol 'b'.
% If a sequence  punctuation marks is passed the behaviour is as if each
% prefix had been to. Thus after the above plus
%     lex_keywords '("<==>");
% the behaviour is just as if the user had presented
%     lex_keywords '(":" ":=" "<" "<=" "<==" "<==>");
% and any grammar using the lexer may thus need to deal with the intermediate
% cases.
%
% Input that is not exactly the string of characters making up a keyword will
% not be read as a keyword. That means that escape characters (!) have an
% effect. For alphanumeric cases the result will just be a symbol
%     beg!in            is the symbol whose name is 'begin'.
% For punctuation sequences an exclamation mark terminates a token and
% starts another (which will then always be a symbol). So
%     <=!=>             is the keyword '<=' followed by the
%                       symbol '=' followed by the keyword or symbol '>',
%                       much as if it had been written as '<= != >' with
%                       extra whitespace to make eveything clearer. 
%
% lex_keywords can be called multiple times so you do not have to declare
% all your keywords at once.
%
% After use of the lexer it will be desirable to call lex_cleanup() which
% will discard all tables and other information that was created. It will
% typically be vital to do this before starting to create a fresh grammar!
%
% To use the lexer call lex_init() and then repeatdly call yylex();
%
% At present this design provides for having just one lexer (and its tables)
% available at a time. I could imagine wanting to have several available
% for different purposes - the extension of this interface to support that
% case is something I will worry about later - maybe!

%
% The following version of YYLEX provides RLISP with a facility for
% conditional compilation.  The protocol is that text is included or
% excluded at the level of tokens.  Control by use of new reserved
% tokens #if, #else and #endif.  These are used in the form:
%    #if (some Lisp expression for use as a condition)
%    ... RLISP input ...
%    #else
%    ... alternative RLISP input ...
%    #endif
%
% The form
%    #if C1 ... #elif C2 ... #elif C3 ... #else ... #endif
% is also supported.
%
% Conditional compilation can be nested.  If the Lisp expression used to
% guard a condition causes an error it is taken to be a FALSE condition.
% It is not necessary to have an #else before #endif if no alternative
% text is needed. Although the examples here put #if etc at the start of
% lines this is not necessary (though it may count as good style?). Since
% the condition will be read using RLISPs own list-reader there could be
% condtional compilation guarding parts of it - the exploitation of that
% possibility is to be discouraged!
%
% "#else" is treated exacty as "#elif t" and any "#else", "#elif" or
% "#endif" statements that are stray at top level not associated with an
% "#if" will be trerated as if there had been an extra "#if t" just before
% the start of the file.
%
% Making the condition a raw Lisp expression makes sure that parsing it
% is easy. It makes it possible to express arbitrary conditions, but it is
% hoped that most conditions will not be very elaborate - things like
%    #if (not (member 'csl lispsystem!*))
%         error(..., ...);
%    #else
%         magic();
%    #endif
% or
%    #if debugging_mode   % NB if variable is unset that counts as nil...
%    print "message";     % ...so care should be taken to select the most...
%    #endif               % ...useful default sense for such tests.
% should be about as complicated as reasonable people need.
%
% Two further facilities are provided:
%    #eval (any lisp expression)
% causes that expression to be evaluated at parse time.  Apart from any
% side-effects in the evaluation the text involved is all ignored. It is
% expected that this will only be needed in rather curious cases, for
% instance to set system-specific options for a compiler.
%
%    #define symbol value
% where the value should be another symbol, a string or a number, causes
% the first symbol to be mapped onto the second value wherever it occurs in
% subsequent input.  No special facility for undoing the effect of a
% #define is provided, but the general-purpose #eval could be used to
% remove the '#define property that is involved. The result generated this
% was is not re-scanned and can not end up being treated as a preprocessor
% directive.
%
% NOTE: The special symbols #if etc are NOT recognised within Lisp
%       quoted expressions, so test like the following will be
%       ineffective:
%            a := '(
%                P
%            #if q_is_wanted
%                Q
%            #endif
%                R);
%       but on the other hand code like
%            if sym = '!#if then ...
%       behaves the way that had probably been wanted. Unlike the C
%       preprocessor, this system recognizes directives within rather than
%       just at the start of lines.

% This skips to the next "#endif", and if its argument is true

% treatments that may be worth noting:
% (1) As it scans if this code finds a futther "#if" it will skip
%     ahead to the "#endif" matching that before looking for the "#endif"
%     that it wants.
% (2) A word "#if" or "#endif" that is entered with escape characters
%     will not be treated as special. So "!#endif" and "#!endif" and
%     "#endi!f" (and so on) are treated as being merely random tokens and
%     so are skipped past.
% (3) Comments and all material in them are ignored while setching for
%     the "#endif". In RLISP mode that will mean anything from a percent
%     characdter to the end of line, or anything from the symbol "comment"
%     to the next dollar or semicolon.
% (4) If the character "'" (ie single quote) is found then RLISP syntax
%     has that followed by a Lisp style s-expression. Keywords present as
%     or within that expression will not be recognized or processed.
% (5) The keyword "#elif" is not of itself significant, but the item
%     after it will be read as an s-expression and not recognized as a
%     keyword. Similarly for "#eval" and "#define"
% So here is a sequence illustrating some of the above
%        !#endif       [escape character present, so nothing special]
%        '#endif       [Lisp-style quoted, so nothing special]
%        "#endif"      [a string not a symbol, so nothing special]
%        #elif #endif  [In place as a condition for #elif, so nothing special]
%        #eval (de #endif (#endif) #endif) [similarly]
%        comment #endif;  [Within a comment, so nothing special]
%        % #endif      [Within a comment, so nothing special]
%        !#elif #endif [The #elif is escaped so is not special, hence
%                       the #endif here IS noticed and acted upon]
% Is it always fun when there is significantly more comment than code?
