% Since it was first introduced the GNUPLOT package has passed a command
% "set term XXX" to gnuplot, where XXX has typically been x11, aqua, vga
% tek40xx or even dumb. At least with early versions of gnuplot that
% was essential. It is possible - even probable - that modern versions of
% gnuplot inspect their environment and choose a good terminal for themselves.
% But it is reported that even now there are some users who are not content
% with either the choices we make here or the ones that gnuplot makes for
% itself so thet feel that they need to override things by putting directives
% in comfiguration files or ebvironment variables that will control exactly
% how gnuplot behaves. Such people are then invonvenienced if this Reduce
% code forces an issue. So to preserve backwards compatibility and keep
% everybody safe while supporting the latestm this switch is provided.
% The default in "on force_gnuplot_term;" and that behaves just as Reduce has
% for some while. If you specify "off force_gnuplot_term;" then it is probably
% that in many circumstances gnuplot itself will pick sensible options, but
% more importantly you gain the ability to guess better than gnuplot itself and
% force your own customised choice of behaviour using ~/.gnuplot or
% GNUPLOT.INI, or by setting GNUTERM etc - all as described in the gnuplot
% documentation.
% If somebody can show that they have done sufficiently extensive tests using
% a wide range of current and somewhat elderly operating systems as well as
% current and legacy versions of gnuplot so as to document that it would be
% safe these days to make the default of this switch "off" rather than "on"
% we can then change the default.
% A further mess here is that I need to put the switch declaration in
% support/entry.red so that it can be used before gnuplot is loaded and also
% to be fully certain that the establishment of its initial value is not
% re-done during the package loading process. I also need to ensure that
% nothing that depends on it is activated at load time rather than just
% when an attempt is made to create a plot.
