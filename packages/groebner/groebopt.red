%   optimization of the sequence of variables
%

% Optimization of variable sequence;the theoretical background can be found
% in  Boege/Gebauer/Kredel,J.Symb.Comp(1986)I,83-98
% Techniques modfied to the following algorithm
%
% x > y if
%  x appears in a higher power than y
%       or
%  the highest powers are equal, but x appears more often with that power.
%
% An explicit dependency DEPENDS X,Y will supersede the optimality.
