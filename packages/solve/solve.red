% ***** Evaluation Interface *****

% Solvemethods!* is a list of procedures which are able to process
% one problem class. Each of its members must check itself
% whether it can be applied or not. The classical equation solver
% is called if none of the methods can contribute.
%
% Protocol:
%
%   input: PSOPFN standard, where the elements of the input list
%          have been passed through REVAL.
%
%   output:
%          'nil: the algorithm cannot be applied because the problem
%               belongs to a different problem class;
%          '(failed): the problem belongs to the class represented
%               by the algorithm but the program has been
%               unable to compute a result. The problem should
%               not be given to any other method - instead the
%               input should be returned.
%          result: the algorithm has been successful and the final
%               result is returned as algebraic form (including an
%               eventually empty result for an "inconsistent" case).
