% Abstract:
% ---------
% This program is an implementation of the algorithm
% for computation of symmetry adapted bases from the
% theory of linear representations of finite grous.
% Projections for the computation of block diagonal form
% of matrices are computed having the symmetry of a group.
%
%
% REDUCE 3.4 is required.
