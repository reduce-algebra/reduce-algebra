% The code here is loaded rather early in the bootstrap process, and so
% is processed by a provisional rather than the final version of the
% rlisp parser. Most features of the language are available, but do careful
% testing after any edits in case you faul foul of any of the restrictions!

% A few functions will appear again in remake.red, and xslrend.red but
% they are needed at this stage during the bootstrap build of REDUCE.
% So perhaps to avoid repetition I could find somewhere even earlier to
% include it, but for now there is repetition to should be kept in step.


% Since some of the early modules may have tabs in them, we must redefine
% seprp. Note that there is a TAB in this definition and that may not be
% readily visible when merely editing the file.
