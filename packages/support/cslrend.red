% Lists of packages & switches...

% The following code arranges that the list of loadable packages
% is constructed once at compile time. That is good because at that time
% Reduce must be set up so as to have access to the path referred to
% here as "$reduce" and the package map will be within the source tree.
% Otherwise Reduce could not be being built!

% This amazingly long list of switches was created as a by-product
% of building the bootstrap version of Reduce. In that build use of
% the directive that introduces switches is logged. Not all of these switches
% are really aimed at the general public, and almost all only apply when
% some particular module is loaded.

% The extraction of this list from buildlogs/bootstrapreduce.log uses
%    grep "Declaring a switch" buildlogs/bootstrapreduce.log > ...
% followed by minor hand editing then use of sort and dups with a final
% editing pass to get the table neatly lined up.

% I could clearly automake this more thoroughly!

% This list included here was created on August 5th 2014 based on the
% development version of Reduce on that date. I rather expect that new
% flags only get added at a fairly slow rate so this list not always
% being kept up to date may not be a calamity.

% One inessential reference to REVERSIP in this module (left unchanged).

% This file defines the system dependent code necessary to run REDUCE
% under CSL.

COMMENT The following functions, which are referenced in the basic
REDUCE source (RLISP, ALG1, ALG2, MATR and PHYS) should be defined to
complete the definition of REDUCE:

        BYE
        EVLOAD
        ERROR1
        FILETYPE
        MKFIL
        ORDERP
        QUIT
        SEPRP
        SETPCHAR.

Prototypical descriptions of these functions are as follows;

remprop('bye,'stat);

symbolic procedure bye;
   %Returns control to the computer's operating system command level.
   %The current REDUCE job cannot be restarted;
   <<close!-output!-files(); stop 0>>;

deflist('((bye endstat)),'stat);

remprop('quit,'stat);

symbolic procedure quit;
   %Returns control to the computer's operating system command level.
   %The current REDUCE job cannot be restarted;
   <<close!-output!-files(); stop 0>>;

deflist('((quit endstat)),'stat);

symbolic procedure seprp u;
   % Returns true if U is a blank, end-of-line, tab, carriage return or
   % form feed.  This definition replaces the one in the BOOT file.
   u eq '!  or u eq tab!* or u eq !$eol!$ or u eq ff!* or u eq cr!*;

symbolic procedure filetype u;
   % Determines if string U has a specific file type.
   begin scalar v,w;
      v := cdr explode u;
      while v and not(car v eq '!.) do
        <<if car v eq '!< then while not(car v eq '!>) do v := cdr v;
          v := cdr v>>;
      if null v then return nil;
      v := cdr v;
      while v and not(car v eq '!") do <<w := car v . w; v := cdr v>>;
      return intern compress reversip w
   end;

symbolic procedure mkfil u;
   % Converts file descriptor U into valid system filename.
   if stringp u then u
    else if not idp u then typerr(u,"file name")
    else string!-downcase u;


COMMENT The following functions are only referenced if various flags are
set, or the functions are actually defined. They are defined in another
module, which is not needed to build the basic system. The name of the
flag follows the function name, enclosed in parentheses:

        CEDIT (?)
        COMPD (COMP)
        EDIT1   This function provides a link to an editor. However, a
                definition is not necessary, since REDUCE checks to see
                if it has a function value.
        EMBFN (?)
        EZGCDF (EZGCD)
        PRETTYPRINT (DEFN --- also called by DFPRINT)
                This function is used in particular for output of RLISP
                expressions in LISP syntax. If that feature is needed,
                and the prettyprint module is not available, then it
                should be defined as PRINT
        RPRINT (PRET)
        TIME (TIME) returns elapsed time from some arbitrary initial
                    point in milliseconds;



COMMENT The following operator is used to save a REDUCE session as a
file for later use;

symbolic procedure savesession u;
   preserve('begin);

flag('(savesession),'opfn);

flag('(savesession),'noval);


COMMENT make "system" available as an operator;

flag('(system),'opfn);

flag('(system),'noval);


COMMENT to make "faslend" an endstat;

put('faslend,'stat,'endstat);


COMMENT The current REDUCE model allows for the availability of fast
arithmetical operations on small integers (called "inums").  All modern
LISPs provide such support.  However, the program will still run without
these constructs.  The relevant functions that should be defined for
this purpose are as follows;

flag('(iplus itimes iplus2 itimes2 iadd1 isub1 iminus iminusp
       idifference iquotient iremainder ilessp igreaterp ileq igeq
       izerop ionep iequal apply1 apply2 apply3 setcar setcdr), 'lose);

flag('(fp!-infinite fp!-nan fp!-finite fp!-subnorm), 'lose);

COMMENT There are also a number of system constants required for each
implementation. In systems that don't support inums, the equivalent
single precision integers should be used;

% LARGEST!-SMALL!-MODULUS is the largest power of two that can
% fit in the fast arithmetic (inum) range of the implementation.
% This is constant for the life of the system and could be
% compiled in-line if the compiler permits it.

% As of December 2010 CSL will actually support up to 2^27, but until
% people have had several months to install a newly compiled CSL I will
% restrict myself to the limit that applied up until them.

% largest!-small!-modulus := 2**24 - 1;

% Well in August 2011 I conclude that matching the value that PSL uses is
% important for compatibility... so I hope that if PSL ever changes somebody
% will tell me.

% There is an ugliness here that arises because cslrend is processed during

% to be ignored the second time - with pretty bad conseqences. So any function
% that is defined here and needs to be tagged LOSE must have the LOSE
% property explicitly removed ahead of its definition. The same issue arises
% in a few other files that are loaded really early in the bootstrapping part
% of the Reduce build - and obviously for PSL just as much as for CSL.
