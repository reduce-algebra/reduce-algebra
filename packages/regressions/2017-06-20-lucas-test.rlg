% This test file verifies that the code I have for the Lucas Strong
% primality test is good. It does so in two phases.
% First it takes the first 34 known Strong Lucas Pseudoprimes and
% verifies that the pass the test, is that my code labelles them as
% probable primes rather than detecting that they are in fact composite.
% It then checks all odd numbers that are not in this special list
% of exceptions (up to a modest limit) and verifies that the Lucas test
% delivers the same result as my primep32 code (which is independent of it
% and which should be fully reliable up to 2^32).

% A side effect of this is that it does an exhaustive test of primep32
% on small arguments, by checking the results from that aginst the ones
% from the Lucas test together with its list of special cases. I only test
% up to the level I have a comprehensive list pg Lucas Strong Pseudoprimes
% in this file, ie up to aroudn 325000.
