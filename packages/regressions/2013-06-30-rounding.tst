% CSL is moving to use an underlying maths library called "crlibm",
% for "Correctly Rounded libm". This is supposed to deliver correctly
% rounded double-precision results for the basic elementary functions
% sin, cos, exp and log (and a few others) on any machine that uses IEEE
% floating point. And these days I expect that to be universal. Since the
% results are "correct" they should be identical on all platforms - and that
% is something that has not been the case hithertoo.
%
% If these results are "perfect" then they are ones that the PSL system
% could also aspire too.

% 
% In this test I will just exercise sin(x) for x in the first quadrant.
