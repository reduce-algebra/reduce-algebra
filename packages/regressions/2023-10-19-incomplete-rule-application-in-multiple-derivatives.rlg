comment A problem reported by Alan Barnes:
        a rule for derivatives is sometimes not completely applied
        when differentiating more than once;


depend a, r, t, x$



drule := {df(~z, r) => df(z, x)/r when z freeof df}$



r^2*df(a,r,2) where drule;


df(a,x,2) - df(a,x)


r^3*df(a,r,3) where drule;


df(a,x,3) - 3*df(a,x,2) + 2*df(a,x)


end;
