% functions that have been embedded should not be written out in
% fasl files or saved on heap images (for instance it is not always going
% to be certain that the proper identity of the gensym used here will
% survive serialization). This may however be useful for debugging as
% a more flexible alternative to use of "tr foo;". In reduce4 mode this was
% wired into the parser, aned there is a commented out autoload directive
% for the "embfn" function in PSL, so I avoided clashing with that name

% I need to simulate hash tables, which PSL does not appear to provide.
% Well I will provide a minimal functional (but not performance)
% replacement here for use in any Lisp that does not heva a function
% called "mkhash" defined.

% The type is 0 for EQ hashes and all other cases are treated as EQUAL
% ones here. Since I am simulating "hash" tables in PSL using just simple
% association lists I do not have any use for a concept of initial size or
% the factor by which tables expand once they become full.

% I think a nicer implementation would be to use genuine hashed tables with
% PSL providing a function that hashed items. For EQ hashing that could be
% based on the machine representation of the (reference to) an item, while
% for equal it could traverse lists but use the address for symbols. The key
% issue there is that garbage collection moves things around! The neatest idea
% I have about that is to have each hash table record in its header the
% sequence number of garbage collection with respect to which it is valid.
% puthash and gethash would then check that on entry and perform a rehash
% operation if out of date. If one can be confident that garbage collection
% will not be triggered while performing gethash, and if puthash and rehash
% record the garbage collection number when they start and check if items are
% already present first using gethash (and if rehash re0runs itself if it
% finds that a GC happened while it was active). I think all is not too
% messy. But because hash tables are not very heavily used this is not a high
% priority!
