% This nasty fragment of code returns a floating point value that
% is a CRUDE indication of the speed of the machine on which it is running.
% It uses around a second of CPU time the first time it is run, with that
% amount of time not depending on the nature of the host platform.

% The value returned ranges from a bit over 1.0 for the regular version of
% Reduce on a Raspberry Pi (ie about the slowest machine in common use
% today) up to almost 20.0 for the fastest desktop systems of 2018. The idea
% of this is that it can be used with with!-timeout() to end up with
% a time limit that represents at least roughly the same amount of work
% whether run on a fast or slow computer.
% A copy of Reduce build with debugging options, or the CSL "bootstrapreduce"
% can be seriously slower - perhaps by up to a factor of ten. The measurement
% here should not be viewed as a benchmark that is valid in any respectable
% way for comparing performance on different systems, and the exact results
% returned will tend to vary somewhat from run to run. Despite all
% uncertainties it may help make code that wants to set time limits be at
% least roughtly able to set ones based on how much work has to be done.

% I will have a scheme that lets me impose a limit on the time taken by
% a calculation. This works by using a hook function that is called at the
% end of any garbage collection, and so its granularity is not very fine.
% Note in particular that if you have a very large amount of memory and/or
% the calculation involved does not allocate memory as it goes then any
% interruption may be dramatically delayed. However for many cases of
% general algebraic calculations with default allocation memory it will be
% broadly useful!
% It exits using "throw" rather than by raising an error because by doing
% that the guarded code can not use errorset to avoid the interruption.
% The time-limit is passed in units of milliseconds. I am allowed to nest
% uses of "with-timeout" however the inner ones have their time allocation
% capped at the residual of the limit set by any outer one.
%
% Sometimes a user will really want the limit to be an absolute time period,
% as in "give up if I have not got anywhere within an hour", while in
% other cases (perhaps especially in demonstration scripts) the limit will
% want to be normalised against machine seed. So I provide two versions here,
% one for each scenario. The second is called with!-normalized!-timeout and it
% takes its limit in abstract "time units" that are VERY ROUGHLY milliseconds
% on a Raspberry pi, and are of course then much smaller on faster systems.

trap!-time!* := nil; % nil here means no trapping active.

% Note that when I detect a timeout I not only throw an exception, but I
% clear trap!-time!* so that unwinding and processing the timeout will not
% provoke a further activation of the mechanism.
% In CSL the gc-hook function is passed an argument that indicates something
% about the garbage collection that just happened. In PSL it does not have
% an argument.

% When I first coded this I used a "begin/end" block in it, but that impacts
% on "return" statements written within the expression "u". So now I use
% lambda-binding instead. Use of
%  with!-timeout(100, << ... ; return XXX>>);
% is still delicate because the return lies within a lambda expression not
% directly in "program context" but that will either work or at worst
% lead to some diagnostic, while using a "begin/end" here make things appear
% to be OK but to behave unexpectedly.

    (trap!-time!-value());


% Time limit in arbitrary units such that (very roughly) slow and fast
% machines get to do about the same amount of work before being interrupted.
% I think of the argument as being very roughly "Raspberry Pi milliseconds",
% so mid or high-range laptops or desktops will take less than that time.

smacro procedure with!-normalized!-timeout(n, u);
  (lambda !~ott!~;
    (lambda trap!-time!*;
      << trap!-time!* := time() + fix (n/machine_speed());

    (trap!-time!-value());


% A typical use of this would be:
%
%    with!-timeout(7000,               % allow 7 seconds.
%                  perform_some_calculation());
% or
%    with!-normalized_timeout(70000, % 70000 "abstract time units"
%                                    % About as previous case on a mid-range
%                                    % computer of 2018.
%                             perform_some_calculation());
%
% These return an atom if the time limit was exceeded, and otherwise a list
% whose car is the value of the protected expression.

% Note that it will be VITAL that the protected expression be such that
% interrupting it can not leave global variables or data in a state that
% will mess up further computation. If the code binds fluids that will be OK
% because they will be restored in the process of handling the interrupt,
% but Reduce global state, such as that associated with kernel ordering, would
% NOT be restored, and if RPLACx operations are performed in ways that
% could leave data in a temporarily insanitary state then that will be
% dangerous. There could at least in principle be problems with global state
% within the Lisp system too, but at present I can not provide a clear
% statement of what is safe and what might not be. Well input or output
% stream selection certainly represents global state...

% Sometimes I want to have a critical section of code that must
% not be interrupted by a timeout trap. I can arrange that using this
% macro, which disables the timeout for the duration of the evaluation
% of its argument. Note that this needs to be used with some case to
% ensure that the computation that it guards is not terribly length, since
% it is an absolute escape from any surrounding timeout!
