% PUSH and POP

%
% I want something that is broadly equivalent to
%
% smacro procedure push(a, b); car (b := a . b);
% smacro procedure pop(b); prog1(car b, b := cdr b);
% but ideally I would avoid repeated evaluation of v in those cases where
% v is messy. Eg as in "pop(car BIGEXPRESSION)" I would want BIGEXPRESSION
% to be evaluated just once. To achieve that I will use a macro rather
% than an smacro... The function cheaptoevaluate will be used to judge
% whether an expression is "big".

% I originally thought to use regular macros for the expansion here, but that
% make it hard to get "form" called properly on all relevant sub-parts. So
% I use formfns.

% When these "macros" are expanded I want the expansions to be deterministic
% both as a matter of general tidiness and because that will interact better
% with the CSL scheme that compiles some code into C. Specifically I want
% any procedure that uses any of these to expand into EXACTLY the same
% stuff each time it is parsed. This means I can not afford to use regular
% gensyms, since their identity will depend on history. But I still want some
% names that will not clash with anthing else present in the code being
% looked at...
