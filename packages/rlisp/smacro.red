% This function expands an  invocation of a SMACRO.
%
% Getting this right in all cases seems to be harder than I had expected!
% One simple interpretation of what an SMACRO is is that it represents
% a simple textual expansion, so after
%   smacro procedure f(a,b) E;
% any instance of f(A,B) is expanded to E|a=>A,b=>B using textual
% substitution.
% A different intent for SMACRO is that it marks a procedure to be
% compiled/expanded in-line for performance reasons. The code in Reduce
% up to 3.8 implemented something that was part way between those!
%
% Here are some of the critical cases:
%    smacro procedure f a; ... a ... a...;
%    f(A)  ->   ... A ... A ...                               (a)
%      OR  ->   ((lambda (a) ... a ... a ...) A)              (b)
% The first is what textual expansion suggests, but if the argument A
% is either an expensive-to-evaluate form or has side-effects then
% letting it appear several times within the expansion may be bad either
% for semantics or performance or both. A variation on this arises if the
% formal parameter a does not occur at all within the body of the smacro,
% or is guarded there by an IF, and the actual argument has side-effects.
% Then one version of the expansion WILL evaluate the argument while the
% other will or may not.
%
% Reduce 3.8 uses expansion (a) if either the formal a occurs at most
% once in the body OR (b) the actual argument is one of a limited number
% of sorts of form that can be seen to be side-effect free. For smacros
% with two or more arguments it can lambda-lift just some of the parameters.
%
% Here are some cases where this may cause trouble:
%    smacro procedure f a; 'nothing;
%    ... f(print x) ...                   The print does not happen.
%                                         Maybe that was expected!
%    smacro procedure f a; << if nil then a; if nil then a; nil >>;
%    ... f(print x) ...
% Reduce 3.8 uses expansion (b) and so the print DOES happen.
%
% In these examples I will be using PRINT to stand for something arbitrary
% that may have side effects, might yield different results when called twice
% (including GENSYM and CONS) or might be an expensive computation.
%
%    smacro procedure f(a, b); b . a;
%    ... f(print x, print y) ...
% uses expansion (a) and the prints happen in an order that may be
% unexpected.
%    smacro procedure f(a, b); list(a, b, b);
%    ... f(print x, print y) ...
% uses a lambda at least for b, so y only gets printed once, but probably
% before x.
%
%    smacro procedure set_cdr(a, b); << rplacd(a, b); b >>;
%    ... set_cdr(x, cons(p, q)) ...
%    ... set_cdr(x, cddr x) ...
% if CONS is tagged as side-effect free this does TWO conses and the
% results are almost certainly not what is wanted. And simple inline
% expansion in the second case returns a "wrong" value.
%
%    smacro procedure f(a, b); << a := 1; print b; a := 2; print b >>;
%    ... f(v, v+3) ...
% Oh dear: v+3 is probably not tagged as side-effect free and both a and b
% are used twice in the function body. But there seems to be a clear
% expectation that the first argument will be textually substituted so that
% the assignments take full effect.
%
%    smacro procedure f a; ... a ... (lambda (a) ...) ...;
% This might arise if a previous smacro used (b) expansion leading to the
% embedded lambda expression, and the names used for formal in the two
% smacros happened to match. If then textual substitution is performed it
% needs to understand the scope rules of nested lambdas and progs. It
% may also need to know that a symbol at the top level of a prog names a
% label not a variable (and ditto (GO x)).
%
%   smacro procedure f a; while a do print (a := cdr a);
%   x := '(1 2 3); f x; print x;
% Depending on expansion style this prints different values at the end.
%
%   smacro procedure increment a; a := a + 1;
% This illustrates a case where it is clear that a direct textual expansion
% is expected. However despite "car x := car x + 1" being accepted syntax the
% order in which things are done means that "increment (car x)" expands to
% and illegal (setq (car x) (plus (car x) 1)) in Reduce 3.8. And
% increment (getv(x, 2)) becomes ((lambda (a) (setq a (plus a 1))) (getv x 2)).
% because while CAR is tagged as side-effect free GETV is not.
%
% Now by and large these are cases that do not arise too often when smacros
% are used for really simple things and and manually created by people who
% understand what is going on. Well the special treatment in Reduce 3.8 as
% regards how many times a formal is used in the body of the smacro and
% whether the actual argument has side effects suggests that there have been
% problems in individual cases before! But if I try to use the smacro
% mechanism as a generic way of getting in-line compilation I may scan the
% whole source of Reduce and convert small procedures into smacros. And
% then the sorts of issue discussed here bite repeatedly!

% I hope these comments will help anybody writing their own smacros. I
% have introduced a new keyword
%   inline procedure f(x); ...;
% with unambiguous call-by-value semantics, but meanwhile in any automatic
% conversion from procedure to smacro the issues here need to be thought
% about.    ACN September 2010.

% The flag !*loginlines enables reports that may help identify places where
% some of the above issues arise.  ACN March 2013.

% Consider
%   inline procedure foo(x, y); << rplaca(x, 1); y >>;
%   ... foo (v, car v) ...
% Here the arguments in the call are all side-effect free and the body of
% the function only mentions each formal parameter once, so it might
% feel it was safe to substiture and the call would get expanded to read
% << rplaca(v, 1); car v >> which yields the result 1. However with a
% proper call-by-value model you would get the previous value of car v
% from before the rplaca operation happened.
% Another case to consider is
%   inline procedure foo x; << print x; do_something(); print x >>;
%   ... foo(car v) ...
% and if the structure referenced by v is accessible via some other route
% then do_something() might update it - messing with the second call to print.
% There may be two cases that are liable to arise frequently enough to matter
% and that are simple enough to feel safe...
%   symbolic procedure foo(x); x;
%   symbolic procedure foo(x); some_function(x, A, B, ...);

% Of course in real life most instances of calls to inline functions would
% not be problematic however they were expanded, but it is best to have the
% code here so that it can cope with pathological cases.

% (4) [I am not at all certain how well I can check this!]. I want to

%     are (4.1) to detect cases where an argument is only used in a context
%     where its value is ignored, as in "inline procedure f u; << A ; u; B>>;"
%     and (4.2) to detect cases where an argument is used within a branch
%     of a conditional. Note that if I have already filtered on (3) this means

% Now I would rather like to retire smacros completely because of the
% delicacies documented above. But one use for them is to provide constructors
% and accessors for data-structures. A special challange there is that "form"
% process inlines that are seen on the left hand side of assignments. Thus
% if I ever replace inlines with simple functions (even ones that an optimising
% compiler can in-line) I need to do something more about that.
%
% So here I propose syntax that describes new data types. I will illustrate
% it with how it will be used to define the shape of polynomials in the
% file poly/poly.red
%
%    accessors lc . red;
%    accessors (lpow . lc) . !_;
%    accessors ((mvar . ldeg) . !_) . !_;
%    accessors tpow . tc, (tvar . tdeg) . !_;
%    accessors numr . denr;
%
% BEWARE. I have written "!_" here for a plain unadorned underscore even
% though mostly in Reduce you can just write "_". However excalc makes a
% new token "_|" for innerprod and after that an underscore not followed
% by a vertical bar seems to cause a crash in rlisp/tok.red:scan!
%
% The constructors need to be written out by hand as in
%    inline procedure u .+ v; u . v;
% if only because although they deliver cons cells they may do more than that
% (eg at one stage at least it was arranged that powers were stored uniquely).
% The underscore is used for fields that are not to be named. Note that
% several sets of accessors can be defined on one line.
%
% The effect of such a definition will be illustrated here by looking at
% what "accessors (tvar . tdeg) . !_;" corresponds to:
%   << inline procedure tvar u; caar u;
%      inline procedure tdeg u; cdar u;
%      inline procedure set_tvar(u, v); setcar(car u, v);
%      inline procedure set_tdeg(u, v); setcdr(car u, v);
%      put('tvar, 'setqfn, '(lambda (u b) (setcar (car u) v)));
%      put('tdeg, 'setqfn, '(lambda (u b) (setcdr (car u) v))) >>;
% and if !*noinlines is true then the "inline procedure" becomes "symbolic
% procedure" instead. The provision of explicit setter functions is because
% I then wish to consider replacing any "tvar u := v;" with "set_tvar(u, v);"
% which avoids needing having the setqfn information loaded at parse time.
% When (and if) that is ever completed then the 'setqfn stuff can go away.

% I wish to optimise (eg) "car cdr car x" into "cadar x" and this code
% achieves that for me.
