COMMENT. The EDS solve routines are interfaces to the general REDUCE
solver, presenting the results in a form more useful in EDS. The most
primitive is edssolve, which basically just turns off arbvars and
reorganises the answer, and the most sophisticated is edssolvegraded,
which tries to solve the principal part first if the equations are
semilinear. This is useful since the principal part is often less
complex than the rest. Solutions are returned as rmaps, giving
information about both the solution and its applicability.
