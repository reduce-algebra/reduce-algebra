% Description:    EDS is a REDUCE package for symbolic analysis of partial
%                differential equations using the geometrical approach of
%                exterior differential systems. The package implements
%                much of exterior differential systems theory, including
%                prolongation and involution analysis, and has been
%                optimised for large, non-linear problems.
%
%
% Requires:      REDUCE 3.8
%
% Created:       23/6/90  V0       as es.red (with Robin W Tucker)
%
% Modified:     8/8/90   V0.1   Added quasi-linear solving and consist-
%                               ency conditions for simultaneous eqns
%               11/9/90  V0.2    Added resimp in front of all subf, subsq
%                               etc as temporary fix for subf bug.
%               14/5/91  V0.3   Switched off factor (and on exp) in
%                               various routines to make simplifications
%                               work.
%               22/5/91  V0.4    Added subs2 in front of all resimp as
%                               temporary fix for unseen power LET rule
%                               bug.
%               26/11/91 V0.5   Altered algorithm in regchn so that
%                               alpha coefficients are not chosen until
%                               entire chain has been constructed.
%               30/6/92  V1       Renamed exsys.red.
%                               Radically altered exsolve to use modulo
%                               rather than contraction. Eliminated need
%                               for frame vectors. Added extra switches
%                               to allow given, random or (as before)
%                               generic combinations of the independence
%                               1-forms to be used to construct a
%                               regular chain.
%                               Removed many utilities to tools.red.
%               23/7/92  V1.1    Added module `complete'
%               14/3/94  V1.2     Renamed eds.red.
%                               Modified for independent compilation,
%                               and for compatibility with new xideal.
%               25/4/96  V2.0   Total rewrite using parts of earlier
%                               versions.
%                               Added types for EDS and coframing.
%               26/11/96 V2.1    Made cross a bundle product when arguments
%                               share submanifold
%               08/07/03 V2.2    Various bug fixes and updates for REDUCE 3.8
