%% WARNING: This module patches mk!*sq.

%% To do:
%% Improve symbolic set-Boolean analysis.
%% Rationalize the coding?

%% A nice illustration of fancy maths printing in the graphics mode
%% of PSL-REDUCE under MS-Windows and X, but it works properly only with
%% interface versions compiled from sources dated after 14 Feb 1994.

%% Defines the set-valued infix operators (with synonyms):
%%   union, intersection (intersect), setdiff (minus, \),
%% and the Boolean-valued infix operators:
%%   member, subset_eq, subset, set_eq.
%% Arguments may be algebraic-mode lists representing explicit sets,
%% or identifiers representing symbolic sets, or set-valued expressions.
%% Lists are converted to sets by deleting any duplicate elements, and
%% sets are sorted into a canonical ordering before being returned.
%% This can also be done explicitly by applying the unary operator
%% mkset.  The set-valued operators may remain symbolic, but
%% REDUCE does not currently support this concept for Boolean-valued
%% operators, and so neither does this package (although it could).
%% Set-theoretic simplifications are performed, but probably not fully.

%% A naive power set procedure is included as an algebraic example
%% in the test file (sets.tst).


%% A proposed new coding style:
deflist('((local scalar)), 'newnam);
%% (DEFLIST used because flagged eval -- PUT does not work during
%% faslout!)

%% One good reason not to use `\' in place of `!' ?
newtok '((!\) setdiff);
%% NOTE that this works in graphics mode under Windows or X PSL-REDUCE
%% ONLY with versions compiled from sources dated after 14 Feb 1994.
%% The following statement should really be in fmprint.red:
put('setdiff, 'fancy!-infix!-symbol, "\backslash");

%% A set is sorted before it is returned for purely cosmetic reasons,
%% except that together with duplicate elimination this makes the repre-
%% sentation canonical and so list equality can be used as set equality.

symbolic inline procedure sort!-set l;
   sort(l, function set!-ordp);

symbolic procedure set!-ordp(u, v);
   %% Ordp alone (as used by ordn to implement symmetry) looks strange.
   %% This seems like a reasonable compromise.
   if numberp u and numberp v then u < v else ordp(u, v);


%% Set-valued operators:
%% ====================
infix union, intersection, setdiff;
put('intersect, 'newnam, 'intersection);
put('minus, 'newnam, 'setdiff);         % cf. Maple!
precedence setdiff, -;
precedence union, setdiff;
precedence intersection, union;

%% Must be simpfns for let rules to be applicable.
put('union, 'simpfn, 'simpunion);
put('intersection, 'simpfn, 'simpintersection);
put('setdiff, 'simpfn, 'simpsetdiff);

flag('(union intersection), 'nary);     % associativity
put('union, 'unary, 'union);            % for completeness
put('intersection, 'unary, 'intersection);
listargp union, intersection;           % necessary for unary case
%% Symmetry is normally implemented by simpiden, which is not
%% used here and the symmetry is implemented explicitly,
%% but the symmetric flag is also used when applying let rules.
flag('(union intersection), 'symmetric); % commutativity

%% Intersection distributes over union, which is implemented
%% as a rule list at the end of this file.

%% Below ordn sorts for symmetry as in simpiden for symmetric operators

%% Set simplification rules:
%% ========================
