% In earlier versions of Reduce there were various functions where the
% definition were replicated in several places. When these are pure
% duplicates it seems good to lift the definitions to here so that they
% are included just once. So some of the functions defined here may be
% a little specialist and not used in very many places. Others might have
% ended up in the rtools package but are here because they are used by the
% parser (etc) before that module gets built.
