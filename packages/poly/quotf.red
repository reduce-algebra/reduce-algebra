COMMENT in many calls to QUOTF, the result is not checked for NIL
because the caller is sure there will be no remainder, e.g. if the
divisor is a gcd.  This occurs not only at several places in the REDUCE
kernel, but especially in Groebner, which simplifies polynomials with
parameters by dividing out their contents.

In all those cases, QUOTF computes too much: if you divide

   P= p_n x^n + p_n-1 x^(n-1) + ...
   Q= q_m x^m + q_m-1 x^(m-1) + ...
        (the coefficients may be polynomials in other variables)

the result comes only from the first k=(n-m+1) coefficients of P.  The
remaining terms only have influence on the potential remainder.  So it
is not necessary to execute the subtractions completely if we don't
need the remainder (or test for its absence).

You can stop after the the power x^(n-k) in P and x^(m-k) in Q, and in
the loop n down to m you can stop in Q again at each step depending on
the actual k.

The method is a polynomial extension of Jebelean's method for dividing
bignums where you know in advance they have no remainder.  The
resulting code is a modification of the standard QUOTF code in polrep;

  if null !*exp or null !*mcd then quotf(u,v) else quotfx1(u,v);

symbolic procedure quotfx1(p,q);

   % Value is the quotient of P and Q.
