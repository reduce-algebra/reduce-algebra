  abstract = {The quadtrees matrix representation has been recently proposed as
	an alternative to the conventional linear storage of matrices. If
	all elements of a matrix are zero, then the matrix is represented
	by an empty tree; otherwise it is represented by a tree consisting
	of four subtrees, each representing, recursively, a quadrant of the
	matrix. Using four-way block decomposition, algorithms on quadtrees
	accelerate on blocks entirely of zeroes, and thereby offer improved
	performance on sparse matrices. This paper reports the results of
	experiments done with a quadtree matrix package implemented in REDUCE
	to compare the performance of quadtree representation with REDUCE's
	built-in sequential representation of matrices. Tests on addition,
	multiplication, and inversion of dense, triangular, tridiagonal,
	and diagonal matrices (both symbolic and numeric) of sizes up to
	100�100 show that the quadtree algorithms perform well in a broad
	range of circumstances, sometimes running orders of magnitude faster

  abstract = { The most voluminous bibliography of the analytical methods for calculating
	of integrals is represented in the article [19]. It is shown there
	that the most effective and the simplest algorithm of analytical
	integration was made by O.I. Marichev [8, 9, 12]. Later it was realized
	in the reference-books [16-18, 20]. This algorithm allows us to calculate
	definite and indefinite integrals of the products of elementary and
	special functions of hypergeometric type. It embraces about 70 per
	cent of integrals which are included in the world reference-literature.
	It allows to calculate many other integrals too. The present article
	contains short description of this algorithm and its realization
	in the REDUCE system during the process of creation of INTEGRATOR
	system. Only one general method of integration is known to be realized
	on the computers, i.e. criterion algorithm for calculating of indefinite
	integrals of elementary functions through elementary functions by
	themselves (the authors of it are M. Bronstein and other). The idea
	of our algorithm is in the following. The initial integrals is transformed
	to contour integral from the ratio of products of gamma-functions
	by means of Mellin transform and parseval equality. The residue theorem
	is used for the calculating of the received integral which due to
	the strict rules results in sums of hypergeometric series. The value
	of integral itself and the integrand functions are the special cases
	of the well-known Meijer's G-function [4, 7, 8, 12, 14, 18]. Programming
	packet is realized in programming languages PASCAL and REDUCE. It
	also offers the opportunity of finding the values for some classical
	integral transforms (Laplace, Hankel, Fourier, Mellin and etc.).
	The REDUCE's part of packet contains the main properties of the well-known
	special functions, such as the Bessel and gamma-functions and kindred
	functions, Anger function, Weber function, Whittaker functions, generalized
	hypergeometric functions. Special place in the packet is occupied
	by Meijers's G-function for which the main properties such as finding
	the particular cases and representation by means of hypergeometric
	series are realized.},

	$\kappa$-fold Euler sums, with all possible alternations of sign,
	and exponents summing to $l$. Its form is remarkably simple: $\Sum_\cal
	E(k + 2n, k)x^n$ = $\Sum_d|k$ $\mu(d)$ $(1 - x^d)^k/d$ $/k$, where
	$\mu$ is the M\"{o}bius function. Equivalently, the size of the search
	space in which $\kappa$-fold Euler sums of level l are reducible
	to rational linear combinations of irreducible basis terms is $\cal
	S(l, k)$ = $\Sum_n<k Analytical methods, using Tony Hearn's REDUCE,
	achieve this reduction for the 3698 convergent double Euler sums
	with $l\leq 44$; numerical methods using David Bailey's MPPSLQ, achieve
	it for the 1457 convergent $\cal$-fold sums with $l\leq 7$; combined
	methods yield bases for all remaining search spaces with $\cal S(l,
	k)$ \leq 34$. These findings confirm expectations based on Dirk Kreimer's
	connection of knot theory with quantum field theory. The occurrence
	in perturbative quantum electrodynamics of all 12 irreducible Euler
	sums with $l \leq 7$ is demonstrated. It is suggested that no further
	transcendental occurs in the four-loop contributions to the electron's
	magnetic moment. Irreducible Euler sums are found to occur in explicit
	analytical results, for counterterms with up to 13 loops, yielding
	transcendental knot-numbers, up to 23 crossings.}

  abstract = {The real part of the virtual Compton amplitude can be directly determined
	from measurements of electron (or muon) bremsstrahlung or pair photoproduction.
	In general, the interference of the Compton amplitude with the Bethe-Heitler
	amplitude for pair production or bremsstrahlung yields a contribution
	to the cross section which is antisymmetric when the leptons are
	interchanged. This interference contribution thus produces different
	cross sections for electron and positron bremsstrahlung at a given
	scattering energy and angle. Also, the counting rate for pair production
	will depend on which lepton has the greater momentum. The determination
	of the real part of the Compton amplitude would supply information
	on the isobar resonance shape, test the dispersion relation for the
	forward amplitude, and resolve uncertainties in the determination
	of the nucleon resonances. A simple estimate for the lepton asymmetry
	of the pair production cross sections due to the forward Compton
	amplitude is given, in addition to a complete calculation of the
	effect of the first nucleon resonance using the isobar model. The
	results are also discussed for nuclear targets. For the latter case,
	a broadening of the isobar decay width due to absorption in the nuclear
	medium must be taken into account.},

	technique has been used to evaluate the swallowtail canonical integral

	plots of mod S(x,y,z) mod , mod delta S/ delta x mod , mod delta
	S/ delta y mod , mod delta S/ delta z mod are presented and some
	properties of the zeros of S(0,y,z) that lie on the line y=0 are
	also discussed. Two methods for the evaluation of the mapping parameters
	(x,y,z) are described: an iterative method that is valid when (x,y,z)
	is not close to the swallowtail caustic and an algebraic method valid
	for (x,y,z) on the caustic and for y=0. Symbolic algebraic computer
	programs have been used to carry out the necessary algebraic manipulations.
	In practice both methods for determining (x,y,z) are complementary.
	An application of the uniform swallowtail approximation to the butterfly
	canonical integral has been made. The uniform asymptotic swallowtail

	The symbolic programming language REDUCE was used to provide independent

	locations, we used a standard zero-finding routine to find the zeros
	of the scattering coefficient denominators. In addition, we used

	to ensure that all poles within a given region of the complex plane
	were found. The real parts of the calculated poles agree with the
	location of peaks in the resonance spectrum (calculated for real
	frequency excitation), whereas the imaginary parts are related to
	the widths of these peaks. The intensity inside the sphere, averaged
	over all spherical angles, was computed as a function of radius.
	When the particle is excited at resonance, the internal intensity
	exhibits a sharp peak near, but not on, the surface. The intensity
	was found to be the strongest when the particle is driven at resonant
	frequencies whose poles have small imaginary components in the complex

  abstract = { An example of a problem in the physical sciences is discussed where
	application of various symbolic computation facilities available
	in many algebraic computing systems leads to a significant expansion
	of the range problems that can be solved. Since most interesting
	problems in the physical sciences eventually require the numerical
	solution of systems of equations, of various types, we will introduce
	an example and describe an approach to a solution, beginning at the
	development of relevant differential equations, using, for example
	REDUCE, and leading eventually to the generation of highly efficient
	and stable numerical code for the solution, using, in our case, the
	C language. The use of SCOPE and GENTRAN, as well as series packages
	in REDUCE will be discussed.In many areas of interest, a considerable
	amount of work has to be performed to arrive at the symbolic equations
	to solve, and this is particularly true in General Relativity and
	related gravitation theories. Some packages, such as REDTEN [1],
	for calculation in this field will be discussed. },

	the various positive- and negative-energy states, have been considered

	truncated matrices based on an incomplete set of basis states were

	which allows the external momenta to be completely off shell so that
	the irreducible graphs can be used as kernels in the Bethe-Salpeter

	for the analysis of experiments in which polarized electrons (muons)
	are scattered from spin zero and from polarized spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
	targets. The analysis is based upon the single virtual photon representation
	of the electromagnetic interaction, initially, neither high-energy
	nor low-energy approximations are made so that one may derive results
	in which the orientation of the polarization vectors of the interacting
	particles changes as a result of the scattering. The general formulation
	is valid for all polarization configurations for the electron and
	nucleon in deep inelastic scattering, and for all polarization configurations
	for the initial and final state particles in elastic scattering.
	From the general covariant results, specific cross sections are derived
	for deep inelastic scattering as well as elastic scattering of electrons
	on muons, nucleons, and spin zero targets. In the latter case, the
	actual polarization vector for the scattered electron is determined.
	In the other cases discussed, this vector may be obtained from the
	cross sections. In addition, a method is presented for defining covariant
	cross sections, and this method is used to obtain results in the
	center-of-mass system as well as the laboratory system. Furthermore,

  abstract = { Systems of polynomial equations often have symmetry. The Buchberger
	algorithm which may be used for the solution ignores this symmetry.
	It is restricted to moderate problems unless factorizing polynomials
	are found leading to several smaller systems. Therefore two methods
	are presented which use the symmetry to find factorizing polynomials,
	decompose the ideal and thus decrease the complexity of the system
	a lot. In a first approach projections determine factorizing polynomials
	as input for the solution process, if the group contains reflections
	with respect to a hyperplane. Two different ways are described for
	the symmetric group Sm and the dihedral group Dm. While for Sm subsystems
	are ignored if they have the same zeros modulo G as another subsystem,
	for the dihedral group Dm polynomials with more than two factors
	are generated with the help of the theory of linear representations
	and restrictions are used as well. These decomposition algorithms
	are independent of the finally used solution technique. We used the
	REDUCE package Groebner to solve examples from CAPRASSE, DEMARET
	and NOONBURG which illustrate the efficiency of our REDUCE program.
	A short introduction to the theory of linear representations is given.
	In a second approach problems of another class are transformed such
	that more factors are found during the computation; these transformations
	are based on the theory of linear representations. Examples illustrate
	these approaches. The range of solvable problems is enlarged significantly.},

  abstract = {In this paper we consider an algorithmic technique more general than
	that proposed by Zharkov and Blinkov for the involutive analysis
	of polynomial ideals. It is based on a new concept of involutive
	monomial division which is defined for a monomial set. Such a division
	provides for each monomial the self-consistent separation of the
	whole set of variables into two disjoint subsets. They are called
	multiplicative and non-multiplicative. Given an admissible ordering,
	this separation is applied to polynomials in terms of their leading
	monomials. As special cases of the separation we consider those introduced
	by Janet, Thomas and Pommaret for the purpose of algebraic analysis
	of partial differential equations. Given involutive division, we
	define an involutive reduction and an involutive normal form. Then
	we introduce, in terms of the latter, the concept of involutivity
	for polynomial systems. We prove that an involutive system is a special,
	generally redundant, form of a Gröbner basis. An algorithm for construction
	of involutive bases is proposed. It is shown that involutive divisions
	satisfying certain conditions, for example, those of Janet and Thomas,
	provide an algorithmic construction of an involutive basis for any
	polynomial ideal. Some optimization in computation of involutive
	bases is also analyzed. In particular, we incorporate Buchberger's
	chain criterion to avoid unnecessary reductions. The implementation
	for Pommaret division has been done in Reduce.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for construction of minimal
	involutive polynomial bases which are Gröbner bases of the special
	form. The most general involutive algorithms are based on the concept
	of involutive monomial division which leads to partition of variables
	into multiplicative and non-multiplicative. This partition gives
	thereby the self-consistent computational procedure for constructing
	an involutive basis by performing non-multiplicative prolongations
	and multiplicative reductions. Every specific involutive division
	generates a particular form of involutive computational procedure.
	In addition to three involutive divisions used by Thomas, Janet and
	Pommaret for analysis of partial differential equations we define
	two new ones. These two divisions, as well as Thomas division, do
	not depend on the order of variables. We prove noetherity, continuity
	and constructivity of the new divisions that provides correctness
	and termination of involutive algorithms for any finite set of input
	polynomials and any admissible monomial ordering. We show that, given
	an admissible monomial ordering, a monic minimal involutive basis
	is uniquely defined and thereby can be considered as canonical much
	like the reduced Gröbner basis.},

  abstract = { The investigation of the problem of integrability of polynomial-nonlinear
	evolution equations, in particular, verifying the existence of the
	higher symmetries and conservation laws can often be reduced to the
	problem of finding the exact solution of a complicated system of
	nonlinear algebraic equations. It is remarkable that these algebraic
	equations can be not only obtained completely automatically by computer
	[1] but also often not only completely solved by computer, in spite
	of their complicated structure and often infinitely many solutions.
	We demonstrate this fact using the Groebner basis method [2] and
	obtain all (infinitely many) solutions of the systems of algebraic
	equations which are equivalent to integrability of three different
	multiparametric families of NLEEs [1]: the seventh order scalar KdV-like
	equations, the seventh order MKdV-like equations, and the third order
	coupled KdV-like systems. All our computations have been carried
	out by using the computer algebra system REDUCE (version 3.2) on
	an IBM PC AT-like computer. Because of the fact that the computer
	algebra system REDUCE 3.2 (in particular on IBM PC, and unlike REDUCE
	3.3), has no built-in package for computation of Groebner basis,
	we have written our own program in Rlisp in order to solve systems
	of algebraic equations using Buchberger's algorithm [2]. To make
	the program effecient we have used the distributive form for the
	internal representation of polynomials together with multivariate
	factorization. In order to obtain the (infinitely many) solutions,
	we construct a lexicographic Groebner basis, then we compute, according
	to [3], the dimension and independent sets of variables for the ideal
	which is generated by the input system. Thereafter, we consider each
	set of variables as free parameters and compute a Groebner basis
	leaving the order of the others unchanged. As a result we obtain
	a set of Groebner bases with a simple structure, and the solution
	can be found in an easy way. Our analysis shows that the Groebner
	basis method allows us to obtain the complete set of exact solutions
	for systems of nonlinear algebraic equations which are the necessary
	integrability conditions for NLEEs and therefore to select all integrable
	evolution equations. It is clear that the solvability of the above
	systems and of even more complicated ones is closely connected with
	the property of integrability. In addition to their importance in
	the theory and application of NLEEs, such systems are very useful
	for testing different computer algebra algorithms. One of our system
	is in a list of examples for Groebner basis computations [4].},

	an extension of luckiness to arbitrary (commutative noetherian) base
	rings we show in this paper that for a homogeneous polynomial ideal
	I one lift not only only its Gr{\"o}bner basis but also a homogeneous
	basis of its syzygy module. The same result holds for arbitrary ideals
	and liftings from Z/p to Q. Moreover the same lifting can be obtained
	from a true Gro{\"o}bner trace by linear algebra over Q only. Parallel
	modular techniques allow to find such a true Gro{\"o}bner and a lucky
	prime with high probability. All these results generalize in an obvious
	way to homogeneous modules generated by the rows of matrices with
	polynomial entries. Since luckiness can be weakened to a condition
	that transfers from I to higher syzygy modules the lifting theorem
	generalizes to a lifting theorem for the resolution of I.},

	number of dendritic trees that possessed certain symmetries: all
	branch lengths had to be integral multiples of one another, and all

	is unrealistic, the method has been generalized to treat dendritic
	trees whose branches differ in diameter. The method entails adding

	that the correction terms, as well as the symmetric results, can
	be expressed as combinations of two families of functions. These
	functions, generalizations of those found in our earlier paper, provide
	a precise formalism for analyzing how voltage transients depend on
	the geometrical structure of the dendritic tree. Examples are given

  abstract = {Resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is described by a set of eight
	coupled, nonlinear, three-dimensional, time-dependent, partial differential
	equations. A computer code, IMP (Implicit MHD Program), has been
	developed to solve these equations numerically by the method of finite
	differences on an Eulerian mesh. In this model, the equations are
	expressed in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, making the code
	applicable to a variety of coordinate systems. The Douglas-Gunn algorithm
	for Alternating-Direction Implicit (ADI) temporal advancement is
	used to avoid the limitations in timestep size imposed by explicit
	methods. The equations are solved simultaneously to avoid syncronization
	errors. While the continuity and magnetic flux equations are expressed
	as conservation laws, the momentum and energy equations are nonconservative.
	This is to: (1) provide enhanced numerical stabillity by eliminating
	errors introduced by the nonvanishing of $\nabla \bullet B$ on the
	finite difference mesh; and, (2) allow the simulation of low $\beta$
	plasmas. To allow for general simulations, the boundary conditions
	may be Dirichlet, Neumann, or periodic. A conservation boundary condition
	based on the physical properties of the wall is presented. The resulting
	finite difference equations are a coupled system of nonlinear algebraic
	equations which are solved by the Newton-Raphson iteration technique.
	
	We apply our model to a number of problems of importance in magnetic
	fusion research. Ideal and resistive internal kink instabilities
	are simulated in a Cartesian geometry. Growth rates and nonlinear
	saturation amplitudes are found to be in agreement with previous
	analytic and numerical predictions. We also simulate these instabilities
	in a square cross section torus. This demonstrates the versatility
	of the orthogonal curvilinear coordinate representation employed
	by our model. In both geometries, long time simulations in resistive
	plasmas display final states with finite flow fields. Finally, we
	perform a simulation of the spontaneous field reversal in a high
	current pinch. In this case, relaxation to a field reversed geometry
	is demonstrated both for a plasma that initially has a high pinch
	ratio $(B_\odot/B_{z} > 1.6)$, and for one that initially has a low
	pinch ratio and is subjected to an external electric field to increase
	the internal current. In these final Reversed Field Pinch (REP) cases,
	we find that the resistive internal kink is the mechanism which causes
	the field reversal.},

	and discuss possibilities for inverting complex extended sources
	of elastic deformation. The nonuniqueness of the inversion can be

	double couple and compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) types.
	We investigate the statistical properties of these two components
	of seismic sources in terms of the invariants of the seismic moment
	tensor of a realistic set of synthetic earthquakes. It is very likely
	that the size of the CLVD component is two to three orders of magnitude
	smaller than that of the double couple component.},

	addition, subtraction and multiplication on our LISP-based system
	are nearly the same as or rather faster than those on the FORTRAN-based
	system. This high efficiency of basic arithmetic operations in our
	system is essentially due to the efficient big-integer routines in
	a host LISP-system written in an assembly language. Evaluation speeds
	of the test problems themselves on the LISP-based system are, on
	an average, 1.5 times slower than those on the FORTRAN-based system.
	The ratio of the evaluation speeds depends, however, very much on
	how the routines of test problems are programmed. Therefore, we conclude
	that the speed of a LISP-based big-float system can be reduced to
	within two times of that of a FORTRAN-based system.},

	It can also generate a vectorizable code, which can achieve high

	polynomials and special functions, that are determined by algorithmical

	In the first section, we present new results, especially for discrete
	families of orthogonal polynomials, obtained by an application of
	the celebrated Zeilberger algorithm.
	
	Next, we present algorithms for holonomic families $f(n,x)$ of special
	functions which possess a derivative rule. We call those families
	admissible. A family $f(n,x)$ is holonomic if it satisfies a holonomic
	recurrence equation with respect to n, and a holonomic differential
	equation with respect to x, i.e. linear homogeneous equations with
	polynomial coefficients.
	
	The rather rigid property of admissibility has many interesting consequences,
	that can be used to generate and verify identities for these functions
	by linear algebra techniques. On the other hand, many families of
	special functions, in particular families of orthogonal polynomials,
	are admissible. We moreover present a method that generates the derivative
	rule from the holonomic representation of a holonomic family.
	
	As examples, we find new identities for the Jacobi polynomials and
	for the Whittaker functions, and for families of discrete orthogonal
	polynomials by the given approach.
	
	Finally, we present representations for the parameter derivatives
	of the Gegenbauer and the generalized Laguerre polynomials.}

	However, only a very small fraction of all such trace maps are similar
	to the Fibonacci golden-mean trace map in that I is their invariant.
	In addition to the known case of the precious-mean lattices (precious
	means are ratios of the form $^{1}_{2}[m+(m^{2}+4)^{1/2}]$, m being
	any positive integer; m=1 gives the golden mean), we have identified
	two new large clases of substitution rules that give trace maps with
	invariant I. One of them is a superset of the precious-mean lattices.
	All other cases represent a vast assortment of different trace maps
	(and thus the potential for various hitherto unexplored spectral
	properties) with a unifying feature that the set I=0 plays the role
	of an attractor in the trace space. In most (but not all) cases,
	two chains with identical trace maps (and thus identical spectra)
	are locally isomorphic. Generally, local isomorphism equivalence
	classes seem to be subsets of identical spectrum equivalence classes.},

  abstract = { The article deals with automation of the process of numerical solving
	of partial differential equations systems (PDES) by means of computer
	algebra. For solving PDES the finite difference method is applied.
	The computer algebra system REDUCE and the numerical programming
	language FORTRAN are used in the methodology presented, its main
	aim being to speed up the process of preparing numerical programs
	for solving PDES. Quite often, especially for complicated systems,
	this process is a tedious and time consuming task. In the process
	several stages can be found in which computer algebra can be used
	for performing routine analytical calculations, namely: transformation
	of differential equations into different coordinate systems, discretization
	of differential equations, analysis of difference schemes, and generation
	of numerical programs. The FIDE package consists of the following
	modules that have been built, tested, and documented: EXPRESS for
	transforming PDES into any orthogonal coordinate system. IIMET for
	discretization of PDES by integro-interpolation method. APPROX for
	determining the order of approximation of difference schemes. CHARPOL
	for calculating the amplification matrix and characteristic polynomial
	of difference schemes, which are needed in the Fourier stability
	analysis. HURWP for locating polynomial roots necessary in verifying
	the von Neumann stability condition. LINBAND for generating the block
	of FORTRAN code, which solves a system of linear algebraic equations
	with band matrix appearing frequently in difference schemes. The
	FIDE package is applied to two physical problems. The first one is
	the nonlinear Schr�dinger equation, which describes several physical
	phenomena, e.g. the Langmuir waves in plasma. The second one is the
	Fokker-Planck equation in diffusive approximation, which is used
	to describe the kinetics of electrons in plasma, including interactions
	of electrons with a laser beam through inverse bremsstrahlung. The
	numerical programs have been tested and compared with similar calculations
	published so far.},

  abstract = {The support operator method designs mimetic finite difference schemes
	by first constructing a discrete divergence operator based on the
	divergence theorem, and then defining the discrete gradient operator
	as the adjoint operator of the divergence based on the Gauss theorem
	connecting the divergence and gradient operators, which remains valid
	also in the discrete case. When evaluating the discrete gradient
	operator, one needs to define discrete inner products of two discrete
	vector fields. The local discrete inner product on a given triangle
	is defined by a 3×3 symmetric positive definite matrix M defined
	by its six independent elements–parameters. Using the Gauss theorem
	over our triangle, we evaluate the discrete gradient in the triangle.
	We require the discrete gradient to be exact for linear functions,
	which gives us a system of linear equations for elements of the matrix
	M. This system, together with inequalities which guarantee positive
	definiteness of the matrix M, results in a one parameter family of
	inner products which give exact gradients for linear functions. The
	traditional inner product is a member of this family. The positive
	free parameter can be used to improve another property of the discrete
	method. We show that accuracy of the method for quadratic functions
	improves with decreasing this parameter, however, at the same time,
	the condition number of the matrix M, which is the local matrix of
	the linear system for computing the discrete gradient, increases
	to infinity when the parameter goes to zero, so one needs to choose
	a compromise between accuracy and solvability of the local system.
	Our analysis has been performed by computer algebra tools which proved
	to be essential.},

	of first order ODEs. Two different REDUCE implementations (PSODE
	versions 1 & 2) of this procedure are presented in this paper. The
	aim is to investigate which implementation is more efficient in solving
	different types of ODEs (such as exact, linear, separable, linear
	in coefficients, homogeneous or Bernoulli equations). The test pool
	is based on Kamke's collection of first order and first degree ODEs.
	Experimental results, timings and comparison of efficiency and solvability
	with the present REDUCE differential equation solver (ODESOLVE) and
	a MACSYMA implementation (ODEFI) of the {Prelle-Singer} procedure
	are provided. Discussion of technical difficulties and some illustrative
	examples are also included.},

	came after that, and made it possible to try the method on a large
	range of integrals. These practical studies showed up some problems
	with the method and its implementation. The presentation given here
	re-expresses the 1976 Risch method in terms of rewrite rules, and
	thus exposes the major problem it suffers from as a manifestation
	of the fact that in certain circumstances the set of rewrites generated
	is not confluent. This difficulty is then attacked using a critical-pair/completion
	(CPC) approach. For very many integrands it is then easy to see that
	the initial set of rewrites used in the early implementations [1]
	and [3] do not need any extension, and this fact explains the high
	level of competence of the programs involved despite their shaky
	theoretical foundations. For a further large collection of problems
	even a simple CPC scheme converges rapidly; when the techniques presented
	here are applied to the REDUCE integration test suite in all applicable
	cases a short computation succeeds in completing the set of rewrites
	and hence gives a secure basis for testing for integrability. This
	paper describes the implementation of the CPC process and discusses
	current limitations to and possible future extended applications
	of it.},

	applications to users. It thus emphasises robustness, portability
	and small size rather than support for an integrated programming
	environment. Both portability and compactness are served by making
	CSL compile the bulk of applications code into a compact byte-code
	instruction set which is then emulated. The speed penalities inherent
	in this are offset by providing instrumentation that makes it easy
	to identify code hot-spots, and a second compiler that translates
	critical parts of the original Lisp into C for incorporation in the
	CSL kernel. For use with REDUCE it is found that compiling about
	5% of the source code into C led to overall performance competetive
	with other Lisp implementations.},

	the application of centre manifold theory is to divide the physical
	domain into small elements by introducing insulating internal boundaries
	which are later removed. Burgers' equation is used as an example
	to show how the concepts work in practise. The resulting finite difference
	models are shown to be significantly more accurate than conventional
	discretisations, particularly for highly nonlinear dynamics. This
	centre manifold approach treats the dynamical equations as a whole,
	not just as the sum of separate terms---it is holistic. The techniques

	the package OCCAL (mnemotechnically for Optimal Control CALculator)
	permits an interactive use, covering tasks like automatic determination
	of control and, in case of a singular control, of its order. In simpler
	problems, the present version of OCCAL automatically produces the
	full subroutine input for a MULtiple shooting code (MULCON) with
	adaptive numerical CONtinuation.
	
	In more complicated problems where singular sub-arcs may occur or
	where the sequence of sub-arcs of the optimal trajectory is unclear
	OCCAL is a significant help in reducing analytic pre-processing.

  abstract = {The problem of stability of the triangular libration points in the
	planar circular restricted three-body problem is considered. A software
	package, intended for normalization of autonomous Hamiltonian systems
	by means of computer algebra, is designed so that normalization problems
	of high analytical complexity could be solved. It is used to obtain
	the Birkhoff normal form of the Hamiltonian in the given problem.
	The normalization is carried out up to the 6th order of expansion
	of the Hamiltonian in the coordinates and momenta. Analytical expressions
	for the coefficients of the normal form of the 6th order are derived.
	Though intermediary expressions occupy gigabytes of the computer
	memory, the obtained coefficients of the normal form are compact
	enough for presentation in typographic format. The analogue of the
	Deprit formula for the stability criterion is derived in the 6th
	order of normalization. The obtained floating-point numerical values
	for the normal form coefficients and the stability criterion confirm
	the results by Markeev (1969) and Coppola and Rand (1989), while
	the obtained analytical and exact numeric expressions confirm the
	results by Meyer and Schmidt (1986) and Schmidt (1989). The given

  volume = {34},

  abstract = {As a language for exchanging computer-"understandable" representations
	of mathematical formulas and concepts, OpenMath has a fairly standard
	syntactic structure for most of the mathematical notions that have
	so far been formalized in its "Content Dictionaries." The syntax
	for most operators is closely related to the well-known and decades-old
	LISP prefix notation for function application.For syntactic representations
	of a particular large class of mathematical operators, however, OpenMath
	takes a very unusual approach when compared with any of the existing
	Computer Algebra systems, say. This class contains integration and
	differentiation operators, sums and products, and other generalized
	quantifiers.In our paper we argue that OpenMath's novel approach
	to representing generalized quantifiers is superior to the classic
	representations. In particular, we show that this unusual feature
	of OpenMath has been designed to adhere to the Compositionality Principle[10],
	a design principle that classic representations, including older
	versions of OpenMath, have been violating[12].Having thus shown the
	importance of compositionality for the design of modern OpenMath,
	we then proceed to show that the Compositionality Principle is a
	fundamental research instrument in the Formal Semantics branch of
	linguistics[9], and argue that, like the use of this particular guiding
	principle for improvements in the design of a representation for
	generalized quantifiers, the study of the underlying structure of
	natural language as discovered by various branches of linguistics
	can provide many more suggestions for further improvements to OpenMath
	and to its sibling, MathML. We give some examples to substantiate
	our claim.},

	of two independent steps: transformation of a nonlinear polynomial
	differential equation into a nonlinear algebraic system and the search
	for solutions of the obtained system. It has been demonstrated by
	the example of the generalized H\'{e}non-Heiles system that the use
	of the Laurent-series solutions of the initial differential equation
	assists to solve the obtained algebraic system and, thereby, simplifies
	the search for elliptic solutions. This procedure has been automatized
	with the help of the computer algebra systems Maple and REDUCE. The
	Laurent-series solutions also assist to solve the inverse problem:
	to prove the non-existence of elliptic solutions. Using the Hone's
	method based on the use the Laurent-series solutions and the residue
	theorem, we have proved that the cubic complex one-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau
	equation has neither elliptic standing wave nor elliptic travelling
	wave solutions. To find solutions of the initial differential equation
	in the form of the Laurent series we use the Painlev\'{e} test.},

	$F_{p}[X,X_{1}, \dots ,X_{m}]$ in $F_{p}$, that is the field of integers
	defined modulo $p$. In the usual factorization algorithm defined
	by Wang, the given polynolmial $P$ is first factorized modulo $\Delta^{n}$,
	where $\Delta^{n}$ is an ideal. This algorithm uses a generalization
	of Hensel's Lemma. If there are no extraneous factors, then the factors
	defined modulo $\delta^[{n}$ correspond to the factors of $P$ in
	$F_{p}[X,X_{1}, \dots ,X_{m}]$ or else the defined factors must be
	regrouped to find the factors of $P$ in $F_{p}[X,X_{1}, \dots ,X_{m}]$.
	In this paper, a mapping that transforms the product of the factors
	into a sum is defined. A theorem that determines whether a subproduct
	of the factors of $P$ corresponds to a factor of $P$ in $F_{p}[X,X_{1},

  abstract = {In the introduction an approach to solving differential equations
	is motivated in which non-linear {DEs} are not attached directly
	but properties like infinitesimal symmetries or the existence of
	an equivalent variational principle are investigated. In the course
	of such investigations overdetermined {PDE-systems} are generated
	which are to be solved (where the term 'overdetermined' just stands
	for 'more conditions than free functions'). In section 2. algorithms
	for simplifying and solving overdetermined {PDE} systems are given
	together with examples. References for more details of the corresponding
	program {CRACK}, written by A. Brand and the author, are given.
	
	In sections 3.-5. applications of the program {CRACK} are discussed.
	The first application is the investigation of symmetries of space-time
	metrics by solving Killing equations for Killing vectors and Killing
	tensors and their integrability conditions. A program {CLASSYM} that
	formulates these equations, written by G. Grebot, is briefly described.
	
	In section 4. an example of the original application of {CRACK} is
	discussed which is the determination of symmetries of a {PDE} system.
	The problem is to find the symmetries of an unusual unified field
	theory of gravitational and hadronic interactions.
	
	The application of symmetries with a program {APPLYSYM} is the content
	of section 5. where an {ODE}, resulting from an attempt to generalize
	Weyl's class of solutions of Einsteins field equations, is solved.
	
	The final section is devoted to future work on, first, making a general
	{PDE-solver} more flexible and effective, and secondly, on applying
	it to more advanced applications. This section contains so far unpublished
	work. An example requiring the extension of {CRACK} to deal with
	non-polynomial non-linearities results from an investigation of interior
	solutions of Einstein's field equations for a sperically symmetric
	perfect fluid in shear-free motion by H. Stephani. A possible future
	application of {CRACK} is the determination of Killing tensors of
	higher rank. In the last sub-section an algorithm for formulating
	corresponding integrability conditions has been sketched. The maximal
	number of Killing tensors of rank $r$ in a $n-dimensional$ Riemannian
	space has been found to be $\frac{1}{r+1}\left(^{n+r-1}_{r}\right)\left(^{n+r}_{r}\right)$.},

	an initially circular, inextensible, cylindrical membrane filled
	with an incompressible viscous fluid when the membrane is placed
	in a two-dimensional shear flow of another viscous fluid. The Reynolds
	numbers of both the interior and exterior flows were assumed to be
	zero (‘creeping flow’), but no further approximations were made in
	the formulation. A series solution of the resulting free boundary-value
	problem in powers of a dimensionless shear rate parameter was constructed
	through fifth order. When combined with a conformal coordinate transformation
	this series gave accurate results for large deformations of the membrane
	(up to an aspect ratio of 2.5). The rather tedious algebraic manipulations
	required to obtain the series solution were done by computer with
	a symbol-manipulation program (reduce), which both formulated the
	boundary-value problems for each successive order and solved them.
	Results are presented which show how the shear rate and fluid viscosities
	influence the internal and external velocity and pressure fields,
	the membrane deformation and its ‘tank-treading’ frequency, and the
	membrane tension.
	
	
	This work demonstrates that classical perturbation techniques combined
