The situation is somewhat more complicated if several such reactions form a linear chain.

The third direction explains how the method can work if a reducible minimal polynomial had been given for an algebraic generator. Any two or all three of the generalizations may be employed simultaneously.},

  Abstract                 = {The quadtrees matrix representation has been recently proposed as an alternative to the conventional linear storage of matrices. If all elements of a matrix are zero, then the matrix is represented by an empty tree; otherwise it is represented by a tree consisting of four subtrees, each representing, recursively, a quadrant of the matrix. Using four-way block decomposition, algorithms on quadtrees accelerate on blocks entirely of zeroes, and thereby offer improved performance on sparse matrices. This paper reports the results of experiments done with a quadtree matrix package implemented in REDUCE to compare the performance of quadtree representation with REDUCE's built-in sequential representation of matrices. Tests on addition, multiplication, and inversion of dense, triangular, tridiagonal, and diagonal matrices (both symbolic and numeric) of sizes up to 100�100 show that the quadtree algorithms perform well in a broad range of circumstances, sometimes running orders of magnitude faster than their sequential counterparts.},

  Abstract                 = { The most voluminous bibliography of the analytical methods for calculating of integrals is represented in the article [19]. It is shown there that the most effective and the simplest algorithm of analytical integration was made by O.I. Marichev [8, 9, 12]. Later it was realized in the reference-books [16-18, 20]. This algorithm allows us to calculate definite and indefinite integrals of the products of elementary and special functions of hypergeometric type. It embraces about 70 per cent of integrals which are included in the world reference-literature. It allows to calculate many other integrals too. The present article contains short description of this algorithm and its realization in the REDUCE system during the process of creation of INTEGRATOR system. Only one general method of integration is known to be realized on the computers, i.e. criterion algorithm for calculating of indefinite integrals of elementary functions through elementary functions by themselves (the authors of it are M. Bronstein and other). The idea of our algorithm is in the following. The initial integrals is transformed to contour integral from the ratio of products of gamma-functions by means of Mellin transform and parseval equality. The residue theorem is used for the calculating of the received integral which due to the strict rules results in sums of hypergeometric series. The value of integral itself and the integrand functions are the special cases of the well-known Meijer's G-function [4, 7, 8, 12, 14, 18]. Programming packet is realized in programming languages PASCAL and REDUCE. It also offers the opportunity of finding the values for some classical integral transforms (Laplace, Hankel, Fourier, Mellin and etc.). The REDUCE's part of packet contains the main properties of the well-known special functions, such as the Bessel and gamma-functions and kindred functions, Anger function, Weber function, Whittaker functions, generalized hypergeometric functions. Special place in the packet is occupied by Meijers's G-function for which the main properties such as finding the particular cases and representation by means of hypergeometric series are realized.},

For intermediate values of N (e.g., 100) these terms give an asymptotic description which, by particle tracking, is shown to be valid. This leads to an estimate of the dynamic aperture and to its possible enlargement.},

In both cases it is shown that one can construct co-adapted copies of Brownian motion such that the corresponding copies of the diffusion will couple in finite time. The first case uses stopping time arguments; the second is computationally more involved and the solution was found using a computer algebra implementation of stochastic calculus (though the final proof has been checked completely by hand). Questions are formulated about coupling problems for more general hypoelliptic diffusions with smooth coefficients.}

This latter equation has two extra parameters, and depending on their sign choices we get a 4-to-1 relationship from NQC to $(Q3)_{\delta=0}$. This leads to a four-term background solution, and then to a 1-soliton solution using a Backlund transformation. Using the 1SS as a guide allows us to get the N-soliton solution in terms of the tau-function of the Hirota-Miwa equation.},

Global identifiability is however difficult to test, since it requires solving a system of algebraic nonlinear equations which increases both in nonlinearity degree and number of terms and unknowns with increasing model carrier. In this paper, a computer algebra tool, GLOBI (GLOBal Identifiability) is presented, which combines the topological transfer function method with the Buchberger algorithm, to test global identifiability of linear compartmental models. GLOBI allows far the automatic testing of a priori global identifiability of general structure compartmental models from general multi input-multi output experiments. Examples of usage of GLOBI to analyze a priori global identifiability of some complex biological compartmental models are provided.},

The solution is based on a series expansion up to the third order in the two transversal angle coordinates and, as a third variable, the bending radius of the particle orbit. The wiggler and undulator fields are represented by an expansion as suggested by K. Halbach.
The report consists of two parts. In the first part we solve the equations of motion by an iteration procedure, which originally was also the first approach. In the second part the solution is based on a Taylor series expansion. Both approaches are equivalent.},
  Abstract2                = {Beside the presentation of the solution, the main topics discussed in the two parts are the calculation speed and accuracy of the algebraic method in comparison to integration methods along undulator fields, as they are typically applied in lattice design codes.
As a further result of the discussion we obtain a proper canonical mapping routine at least as accurate but faster than typical integration routines.}

For the hard-core plus square-well pair-interaction case we have deduced, for two-species fermion matter, perturbation formulas up to sixth order in the attractive coupling parameter. We explicitly report results up to fourth order here. Padé-approximant analyses in the density are carried out in each order with the intent of providing the basis necessary for extensive equation-of-state calculations of various many-fermion systems. In particular, for zero order (the fermion hard-sphere fluid) we predict an uncertainty-principle divergence in the energy, and hence pressure, corresponding to the random close packing of spheres, at a density of about 0.5 times the recently obtained value for boson hard spheres and about 0.2 times the well-known empirical value for classical hard spheres.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of stability of the triangular libration points in the planar circular restricted three-body problem is considered. A software package, intended for normalization of autonomous Hamiltonian systems by means of computer algebra, is designed so that normalization problems of high analytical complexity could be solved. It is used to obtain the Birkhoff normal form of the Hamiltonian in the given problem. The normalization is carried out up to the 6th order of expansion of the Hamiltonian in the coordinates and momenta. Analytical expressions for the coefficients of the normal form of the 6th order are derived. Though intermediary expressions occupy gigabytes of the computer memory, the obtained coefficients of the normal form are compact enough for presentation in typographic format. The analogue of the Deprit formula for the stability criterion is derived in the 6th order of normalization. The obtained floating-point numerical values for the normal form coefficients and the stability criterion confirm the results by Markeev (1969) and Coppola and Rand (1989), while the obtained analytical and exact numeric expressions confirm the results by Meyer and Schmidt (1986) and Schmidt (1989). The given computational problem is solved without constructing a specialized algebraic processor, i.e., the designed computer algebra package has a broad field of applicability.},

  Abstract                 = {Inclusive cross sections for $J/\psi$ production in proton-proton collisions were calculated in the $k_{t}$-factorization approach for the RHIC energy. Several mechanisms were considered, including direct color-singlet mechanism, radiative decays of $\chi_c$ mesons, decays of $\psi'$, open-charm associated production of $J/\psi$ as well as weak decays of B mesons. Different unintegrated gluon distributions from the literature were used. We find that radiative $\chi_c$ decays and direct color-singlet contributions constitute the dominant mechanism of $J/\psi$ production. These process cannot be consistently treated within collinear-factorization approach. The results are compared with recent RHIC data. The new precise data at small transverse momenta impose stringent constraints on UGDFs. Some UGDFs are inconsistent with the new data. The Kwieci\'nski UGDFs give the best description of the data. In order to verify the mechanism suggested here we propose $J/\psi$ -- jet correlation measurement and an independent measurement of $\chi_c$ meson production in $\pi^+ \pi^-$ and/or $K^+ K^-$ decay channels. Finally, we address the issue of $J/\psi$ spin alignment.},

  Abstract                 = {An algorithm with its mathematical foundation concerning {2nd} order ordinary linear differential equations {(OLDE)} is described. It allows one to generate related {four-parametric} families of {OLDE} with coefficients of preassigned (in the scope of the procedure) structures integrable in terms of a given (generating) equation. The number of those families in each next generation grows according to geometric progression with ratio eight. Several examples of both mathematical and physical significance illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm implemented in the {REDUCE} compute algebra system.}

  Abstract                 = {It is shown how the linear Euler-Imshenetskii-Darboux (EID) differential transformation can be used for generating infinite sequences of linear second-order ordinary differential equations starting from certain standard equations. In so doing, the method of factorization of differential operators and operator identities obtained by means of this method are used. Generalizations of some well-known integrable cases of the Schrödinger equation are found. An example of an integrable equation with the Liouville coefficients, which apparently cannot be solved by the well-known Kovacic and Singer algorithms and their modifications, is constructed. An algorithm for solving the constructed class of equations has been created and implemented in the computer algebra system REDUCE. The corresponding procedure GENERATE is a supplement to the ODESOLVE procedure available in REDUCE. Solutions of some equations by means of the GENERATE procedure in REDUCE 3.8, as well as those obtained by means of DSOLVE in Maple 10, are presented. Although the algorithm based on the Euler-Imshenetskii-Darboux transformation is not an alternative to the existing algorithms for solving linear second-order ordinary differential equations, it is rather efficient within the limits of its applicability.},

We furthermore follow the proton-neutron collisional history by means of a phase-space simulation based on the Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck approach for proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions adding up incoherently the yields from each individual collision. The satisfactory agreement we obtain in comparison with experimental data allows to conclude that energetic photons predominantly arise from proton-neutron bremsstrahlung during the early stage of the collision.},

However, because the truncation is small and calculations are performed symbolically in rational arithmetic, many of the standard precepets for numerical use of spectral methods must be modified or reversed. We offer many guidelines and suggestions. Six examples programmed in {REDUCE}, and Maple---eigenproblems, bifurcations, and nonlinear diffusion--illustrate the possibilities.},

  Abstract                 = {A generating function is given for the number, $\cal E(l,k)$, of irreducible $\kappa$-fold Euler sums, with all possible alternations of sign, and exponents summing to $l$. Its form is remarkably simple: $\Sum_\cal E(k + 2n, k)x^n$ = $\Sum_d|k$ $\mu(d)$ $(1 - x^d)^k/d$ $/k$, where $\mu$ is the M\"{o}bius function. Equivalently, the size of the search space in which $\kappa$-fold Euler sums of level l are reducible to rational linear combinations of irreducible basis terms is $\cal S(l, k)$ = $\Sum_n<k Analytical methods, using Tony Hearn's REDUCE, achieve this reduction for the 3698 convergent double Euler sums with $l\leq 44$; numerical methods using David Bailey's MPPSLQ, achieve it for the 1457 convergent $\cal$-fold sums with $l\leq 7$; combined methods yield bases for all remaining search spaces with $\cal S(l, k)$ \leq 34$. These findings confirm expectations based on Dirk Kreimer's connection of knot theory with quantum field theory. The occurrence in perturbative quantum electrodynamics of all 12 irreducible Euler sums with $l \leq 7$ is demonstrated. It is suggested that no further transcendental occurs in the four-loop contributions to the electron's magnetic moment. Irreducible Euler sums are found to occur in explicit analytical results, for counterterms with up to 13 loops, yielding transcendental knot-numbers, up to 23 crossings.}

  Abstract                 = {We evaluate a two-loop diagram, with propagators raised to an integer power $p$ in $4p$ dimensions. For $p<0$ the negative-dimensional integration algorithm of Halliday and Ricotta gives integer results. For $p > 0$ the use of Gegenbauer polynomials gives results involving $\zeta(3)$. An asymptotic expansion is derived for large negative dimensions and found to give highly accurate results at small positive dimensions, confirming the consistency of the methods.},

In the limiting cases $z\to0$, $z\to1$, and $z\to-\infty$, comparisons are made with previous partial results. Approximation methods, based on these limiting cases, are critically assessed, with a view to three-loop work. High accuracy is achieved using a few moments as input. A {\em single\/} moment, combined with only the {\em leading\/} threshold and asymptotic behaviours, gives the two-loop corrections to better than 1\% in the next 10 moments.

Pad\'{e} approximants to truncations of the expansions are shown to be of great utility.

  Abstract                 = {The real part of the virtual Compton amplitude can be directly determined from measurements of electron (or muon) bremsstrahlung or pair photoproduction. In general, the interference of the Compton amplitude with the Bethe-Heitler amplitude for pair production or bremsstrahlung yields a contribution to the cross section which is antisymmetric when the leptons are interchanged. This interference contribution thus produces different cross sections for electron and positron bremsstrahlung at a given scattering energy and angle. Also, the counting rate for pair production will depend on which lepton has the greater momentum. The determination of the real part of the Compton amplitude would supply information on the isobar resonance shape, test the dispersion relation for the forward amplitude, and resolve uncertainties in the determination of the nucleon resonances. A simple estimate for the lepton asymmetry of the pair production cross sections due to the forward Compton amplitude is given, in addition to a complete calculation of the effect of the first nucleon resonance using the isobar model. The results are also discussed for nuclear targets. For the latter case, a broadening of the isobar decay width due to absorption in the nuclear medium must be taken into account.},

We have calculated the electron anomalous moment through fourth order in perturbation theory in agreement with the Sommerfield-Petermann results, and have calculated representative contributions to the sixth order moment. Our results agree with those of Levine and Wright. The validity of the infinite momentum method as a renormalizable calculational procedure in quantum electrodynamics gives field-theoretic parton calculations for composite particles a rigorous basis, provided that a covariant regularization procedure is used.

We derive the rules of calculation at infinite momentum, and introduce a convenient method for automatically including z graphs (backward-moving fermion contributions). We then develop techniques for implementing renormalization theory, and apply these to various examples. We show that the $P\to\infty$ limit is uniform for calculating renormalized amplitudes, but this is not true in evaluating the renormalization constants themselves. Our rules are then applied to calculate the electron anomalous moment through fourth order and a representative diagram in sixth order. It is shown that our techniques are competitive with the normal Feynman approach in practical calculations. Some implications of our results and connections with the light-cone quantization are discussed.},

  Comment                  = {This paper is a survey of applications of systems for symbolic algebraic computation.In most successful applications, calculations that can be taken to a given order by hand are then extended one or two more orders by computer. Furthermore, with a few notable exceptions, these applications also involve numerical computation in some way. Therefore, we emphasize the interfaces between symbolic and numerical computation, including: \begin{enumerate} \item Computations with both symbolic and numerical phases. \item Data involving both the unpredictable size and shape that typify symbolic computation and the (usually inexact) numerical values that characterize numerical computation. \item Applications of one field to the other. \end{enumerate} We conclude that the fields of symbolic and numerical computation can advance most fruitfully in harmony rather than in competition.},

We obtain the susy-B extension, the doubly susy-B extension as well as the N = 1 and the N = 2 supersymmetric extensions for this system. The N = 2 supersymmetric extension is particularly interesting, since it leads to new classical integrable systems in the bosonic limit. We prove the integrability of these systems through the bi-Hamiltonian formulation of integrable models and through the Lax description. We also discuss the supersymmetric extension of the Hunter–Zheng equation which belongs to the Harry Dym hierarchy of equations.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is devoted to the application of computer algebra to the study of solutions of the field equations derived from a non-linear Lagrangian, as suggested by recently proposed unified theories. More precisely, we restrict ourselves to the most general quadratic Lagrangian, i.e. containing quadratic contributions in the different curvature tensors exclusively. The corresponding field equations are then fourth-order in the metric tensor components. The cosmological models studied are the simplest ones in the class of spatially homogeneous but anisotropic models, i.e. Bianchi I models. For these models, we consider only power-law type solutions of the field equations. All the solutions of the associated system of algebraic equations are found, using computer algebra, from a search of its Groebner bases. While, in space dimension d=3, the Einsteinian-Kasner metric is still the most general power-law type solution, for d>3, no solution, other than the Minkowski space-time, is common to thethree systems of equations corresponding to the three contributions to the Lagrangian density. In the case of a pure Riemann-squared contribution to the Lagrangian (suggested by a recent calculation of the effective action for the heterotic string), the possibility exists to realize a splitting of the d-dimensional space into a (d−3)-dimensional internal space and a physical 3-dimensional space, the latter expanding in time as a power bigger than 2 (about 4.5 when d=9).},

Aspects of several previous approaches are combined and extended: adiabatic elimination has previously been used, but centre manifold techniques simplify the noise by removing memory effects, and with less algebraic effort than normal forms; analysis of associated Fokker-Plank equations replace nonlinearly generated noise processes by their long-term equivalent white noise. The ideas are developed by examining a simple dynamical system which serves as a prototype of more interesting physical situations.},

  Abstract                 = {Practical methods for the numerical implementation of the uniform swallowtail approximation have been developed. This approximation arises in the uniform asymptotic evaluation of oscillating integrals with four coalescing saddle points. A complex contour quadrature technique has been used to evaluate the swallowtail canonical integral S(x,y,z) and its partial derivatives delta S/ delta x, delta S/ delta y, delta S/ delta z. This method has the advantage that it is straightforward to implement on a computer and results of high accuracy are readily obtained. A comparison is made with other methods that have been reported in the literature for the evaluation of S(x,y,z). Isometric plots of mod S(x,y,z) mod , mod delta S/ delta x mod , mod delta S/ delta y mod , mod delta S/ delta z mod are presented and some properties of the zeros of S(0,y,z) that lie on the line y=0 are also discussed. Two methods for the evaluation of the mapping parameters (x,y,z) are described: an iterative method that is valid when (x,y,z) is not close to the swallowtail caustic and an algebraic method valid for (x,y,z) on the caustic and for y=0. Symbolic algebraic computer programs have been used to carry out the necessary algebraic manipulations. In practice both methods for determining (x,y,z) are complementary. An application of the uniform swallowtail approximation to the butterfly canonical integral has been made. The uniform asymptotic swallowtail approximation can now be regarded as a practical tool for the evaluation of oscillating integrals with four coalescing saddle points.},

Determining pole locations in the complex plane entailed the computation of spherical Bessel functions for large complex arguments. The symbolic programming language REDUCE was used to provide independent verifications of the convergence and accuracy of the numerical Bessel function routines required in these computations. To determine pole locations, we used a standard zero-finding routine to find the zeros of the scattering coefficient denominators. In addition, we used a separate zero-counting routine in conjunction with the search routine to ensure that all poles within a given region of the complex plane were found. The real parts of the calculated poles agree with the location of peaks in the resonance spectrum (calculated for real frequency excitation), whereas the imaginary parts are related to the widths of these peaks. The intensity inside the sphere, averaged over all spherical angles, was computed as a function of radius. When the particle is excited at resonance, the internal intensity exhibits a sharp peak near, but not on, the surface. The intensity was found to be the strongest when the particle is driven at resonant frequencies whose poles have small imaginary components in the complex plane.},

  Abstract                 = {This book is an introduction to algebraic geometry and commutative algebra aimed primarily at undergraduates. It emphasizes applications and the computational and algorithmic aspects of the subject. Less abstract than other texts, and with prerequisites (a course in linear algebra and any course discussing how to do simple proofs), the text is also ideal for computer scientists as well as mathematicians interested in the subject. The exposition assumes that students have access to a computer algebra system such as Maple, REDUCE or Mathematica, but assumes no prior experience with a computer.

It is shown that, much like in the bosonic cases, the super Moyal-Lax equation can be interpreted as a Hamiltonian equation and can be derived from an action. Similarly, we show that the parameter of non-commutativity, in this case, is related to the central charge of the second Hamiltonian structure of the system. The super Moyal-Lax description allows us to go to the dispersionless limit of these models in a singular limit and we discuss some of the properties of such systems.},

Thus, it should become possible to determine both the cone geometry, as well as the distribution of cosmic matter near the cone, without adopting arbitrary assumptions. The propagation equations determine the gravitational field and the matter distribution at finite distances from the past cone. The author specifies the cone initial data for a general dust model. An explicit procedure in terms of successive integrations is given to determine the gravitational field near the past light cone.},

Eine der Prozeduren schließt die Berechnung der Maxwell-Gleichungen und Invarianten wie auch des Maxwellschen Energie-Impuls-Tensors ein. Eine zweite Gruppe benutzt die Komponenten einer Nulltetrade als Eingang und berechnet die Tetrad-Komponenten des Riemann-Tensors, des Einstein-Tensors und - falls erwünscht - die 14 lokalen Invarianten des Riemann-Tensors. Eine Bestimmung des Petrov-Types ist ebenfalls enthalten.

Störungsrechnungen sind möglich und lassen sich effektiv durchführen. Die Form der Ausgabe ist flexibel. Weitere Programme sind auf Anforderungen verfügbar.

  Abstract                 = {Computer algebra systems typically drop some degenerate case when evaluating expressions, e.g., $x/x$ becomes 1 dropping the case $x=0$. We claim that it is feasible in practice to compute also the degenerate cases yielding guarded expressions. We work over real closed fields but our ideas about handling guarded expression can be easily transferred to other situations. Using formulas as guards provides a powerful tool for heuristically reducing the combinatorial explosion of cases: equivalent, redundant, tautological, and contradictive cases can be detected by simplification and quantifier elimination. Our approach allows to simplify the expressions on the basis of simplification knowledge on the logical side. The method described in this paper is implemented in the {REDUCE} package {GUARDIAN}, which is freely available on the {WWW}.}

We use the constraint that reductions to two dimensions should belong to the known integrale systems. In this way we obtain a classification that is complete to the extent that the two-dimensional results are complete. Two new integrable systems are obtained and their constants of motion explicitly given.},

Since most interesting problems in the physical sciences eventually require the numerical solution of systems of equations, of various types, we will introduce an example and describe an approach to a solution, beginning at the development of relevant differential equations, using, for example REDUCE, and leading eventually to the generation of highly efficient and stable numerical code for the solution, using, in our case, the C language. The use of SCOPE and GENTRAN, as well as series packages in REDUCE will be discussed.In many areas of interest, a considerable amount of work has to be performed to arrive at the symbolic equations to solve, and this is particularly true in General Relativity and related gravitation theories. Some packages, such as REDTEN [1], for calculation in this field will be discussed. },

Specific applications to commonly encountered problems are given. All isovector fields for the following systems are exhibited: steady incompressible viscous flows in 2 spatial dimensions; steady thermal boundary layer equations in 2 spatial dimensions; unsteady incompressible viscous flows in 3 spatial dimensions; and dynamic thermoelasticity in 3 spatial dimensions. These results give immediate information concerning the connectivity of the solution sets and similarity variables. In particular, it is shown that only solutions of the unsteady incompressible viscous flow equations with the same local continuity classes can be connected.},

  Abstract                 = {It is argued that, by computing a few scalar invariants, one may, in practical cases, obtain enough information about the equivalence problem, the Petrov type, and the physical interpretation of a metric through the characterization of its singularities. An interactive algorithm is developed and an application to the Harrison metrics described. In particular, one finds that, allowing for complex coordinate transformations, there are only two distinct Harrison type D metrics.},

In a recent paper Cohen, Leringe, and Sundblad compared six systems for algebraic computations applied to general relativity available in Stockholm. Here we give similar information for CAMAL, and by using the same tests we add CAMAL to the comparison.},

In a recent paper by Bessis, Turchetti, and Wortman, truncated matrices based on an incomplete set of basis states were used and a qualitative description of the energy dependence of the ${}^{3}P_{0}$ phase shift was obtained. In this work it is shown that this result is not obtained when a complete set of basis states is used. The main effect of matrix Padé approximants using a complete set of basis states is to introduce an additional attraction at higher energies. Our analysis of the fourth-order graphs is done in a way which allows the external momenta to be completely off shell so that the irreducible graphs can be used as kernels in the Bethe-Salpeter equation. This will make possible the calculation of several higher-order graphs by iterating the Bethe-Salpeter equation.},

After the rapid development of a great deal of numerical algorithms and codes during the past five decades, it is time that symbolic techniques become available in the chemical sciences. A careful implementation of such symbolic methods will make many tasks more efficient and will facilitate the investigation of many quantum systems. Following a brief account of the advantages and specific requests of applying computer algebra in chemistry and physics, emphasis is placed in this contribution on the BETHE program, a recently developed tool for using point-group symmetries in various fields of chemistry, including molecular spectroscopy, ligand-field theory, and material science, or even for the construction of molecular wave functions. Besides the great promise of symbolic techniques for modern research, their merits for education are pointed out, as computer algebra systems are likely to replace the traditional program languages in the undergraduate programs of chemistry and physics. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Coulomb wave functions are used for the free as well as the bound states and, thus, the results are good for any electron energy. Several interesting effects are found. First, the transition probabilities are maximum for recombination into specific intermediate-angular-momentum states at low energies (w<1 eV) and where the free-state angular momentum is greater than that of the bound state. Further, that specific intermediate-angular-momentum state depends on the kinetic energy of the free electron. This behavior is in contrast to the ‘‘normal’’ behavior of the transition strengths where recombination into s states is greatest and decreases with increasing angular momentum. Second, the quadrupole matrix elements vanish for certain velocities of the free electron. These ‘‘zeros’’ produce minima in the corresponding quadrupole cross sections. Finally, the calculated partial cross sections for recombination into high-angular-momentum states are greater when quadrupole transitions are included.},

We give explicit formulae for all polarization amplitudes of the processes e+e- $\rightarrow$ W+W- and e+e- $\rightarrow$ ZZ, with arbitrary couplings between the various intermediate vector bosons. Using these expressions we discuss possible signatures of C, P andT violation in the three vector boson coupling, as well as the effects of anomalous magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of $W^{\pm}$. The amplitudes for the above processes in any $SU(2) \times U(1)$ and $SU(2)_{L} \times SU(2)_{R} \times U(1)$ gauge theory are also given, while the special case of the Weinberg-Salam model is studied in detail.},

We carry out a detailed comparison of the REDUCE 3.6 and Mathematica(Versions 2.2 and 3.0) from the point of view of their applicability to the solution of the above problems. We draw a conclusion that a preference should be given for Mathematica from the viewpoint of the execution of symbolic–numeric computations. We also describe in detail our new symbolic–numeric algorithm for stability investigation, which was implemented with the aid of Mathematica. The proposed method enables us to reduce the needed computer storage at the symbolic stages by a factor of about 20 as compared with the previous algorithms. A feature of the numerical stages is the use of the arithmetic of rational numbers, which enables us to avoid the accumulation of the roundoff errors. We present the examples of the application of the proposed symbolic–numeric method for stability analysis of very complex schemes of the finite-volume method on curvilinear grids, which are widely used in computational fluid dynamics.},

We study the stability of one of the Jameson's schemes of 1981, which approximates the set of five Navier-Stokes equations completed by the turbulence model of Baldwin and Lomax. The analysis procedure implements the check-up of the necessary von Neumann stability criterion. It is shown with the aid of the proposed symbolic-numeric strategy that the physical viscosity terms in the Navier-Stokes equations have a dominant effect on the sizes of the stability region in comparison with the heat conduction terms. It turns out that the consideration of turbulence with the aid of eddy viscosity model of Baldwin and Lomax has an insignificant effect on the size of the necessary stability region.},

  Abstract                 = {A covariant formulation is developed and used to derive cross-sections for the analysis of experiments in which polarized electrons (muons) are scattered from spin zero and from polarized spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ targets. The analysis is based upon the single virtual photon representation of the electromagnetic interaction, initially, neither high-energy nor low-energy approximations are made so that one may derive results in which the orientation of the polarization vectors of the interacting particles changes as a result of the scattering. The general formulation is valid for all polarization configurations for the electron and nucleon in deep inelastic scattering, and for all polarization configurations for the initial and final state particles in elastic scattering. From the general covariant results, specific cross sections are derived for deep inelastic scattering as well as elastic scattering of electrons on muons, nucleons, and spin zero targets. In the latter case, the actual polarization vector for the scattered electron is determined. In the other cases discussed, this vector may be obtained from the cross sections. In addition, a method is presented for defining covariant cross sections, and this method is used to obtain results in the center-of-mass system as well as the laboratory system. Furthermore, explicit cross sections for virtual photon absorption are derived. Finally, in the appendices, an alternative method for the evaluation of traces is given as well as a discussion of the relativistic limit.},

  Abstract                 = { Systems of polynomial equations often have symmetry. The Buchberger algorithm which may be used for the solution ignores this symmetry. It is restricted to moderate problems unless factorizing polynomials are found leading to several smaller systems. Therefore two methods are presented which use the symmetry to find factorizing polynomials, decompose the ideal and thus decrease the complexity of the system a lot. In a first approach projections determine factorizing polynomials as input for the solution process, if the group contains reflections with respect to a hyperplane. Two different ways are described for the symmetric group Sm and the dihedral group Dm. While for Sm subsystems are ignored if they have the same zeros modulo G as another subsystem, for the dihedral group Dm polynomials with more than two factors are generated with the help of the theory of linear representations and restrictions are used as well. These decomposition algorithms are independent of the finally used solution technique. We used the REDUCE package Groebner to solve examples from CAPRASSE, DEMARET and NOONBURG which illustrate the efficiency of our REDUCE program. A short introduction to the theory of linear representations is given. In a second approach problems of another class are transformed such that more factors are found during the computation; these transformations are based on the theory of linear representations. Examples illustrate these approaches. The range of solvable problems is enlarged significantly.},

In the symbolic part of the algorithm the complete analysis of the symmetry occurs, and it is here where symmetrical normal forms, symmetry reduced systems, and block diagonal Jacobians are computed. Given a particular problem, the symbolic algorithm can create and compute through the list of possible bifurcations thereby forming a {so-called} tree of decisions correlated to the different types of symmetry breaking bifurcation points. The remaining part of the algorithm deals with the numerical pathfollowing based on the implicit reparametrisation as suggested and worked out by {Deuflhard/Fiedler/Kunkel}. The symmetry preserving bifurcation points are computed using recently developed augmented systems incorporating the use of symmetry.},

An expression segmentation facility breaks large expressions into subexpressions of manageable size, and an interface to an existing code optimizer allows sequences of assignment statements to be replaced by their optimized equivalents. In addition, special file-handling facilities allow code generation to be guided by template files and output to be redirected to one or more files.

Therefore, each of them allows one to compute an involutive Gröbner basis of a polynomial ideal by sequentially examining multiplicative reductions of nonmultiplicative prolongations. The dependence of involutive algorithms on the completion ordering is studied. Based on the properties of particular involutive divisions, two computational optimizations are suggested. One of them consists of a special choice of the completion ordering. The other optimization is related to recomputing multiplicative and nonmultiplicative variables in the course of the algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we consider an algorithmic technique more general than that proposed by Zharkov and Blinkov for the involutive analysis of polynomial ideals. It is based on a new concept of involutive monomial division which is defined for a monomial set. Such a division provides for each monomial the self-consistent separation of the whole set of variables into two disjoint subsets. They are called multiplicative and non-multiplicative. Given an admissible ordering, this separation is applied to polynomials in terms of their leading monomials. As special cases of the separation we consider those introduced by Janet, Thomas and Pommaret for the purpose of algebraic analysis of partial differential equations. Given involutive division, we define an involutive reduction and an involutive normal form. Then we introduce, in terms of the latter, the concept of involutivity for polynomial systems. We prove that an involutive system is a special, generally redundant, form of a Gröbner basis. An algorithm for construction of involutive bases is proposed. It is shown that involutive divisions satisfying certain conditions, for example, those of Janet and Thomas, provide an algorithmic construction of an involutive basis for any polynomial ideal. Some optimization in computation of involutive bases is also analyzed. In particular, we incorporate Buchberger's chain criterion to avoid unnecessary reductions. The implementation for Pommaret division has been done in Reduce.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present an algorithm for construction of minimal involutive polynomial bases which are Gröbner bases of the special form. The most general involutive algorithms are based on the concept of involutive monomial division which leads to partition of variables into multiplicative and non-multiplicative. This partition gives thereby the self-consistent computational procedure for constructing an involutive basis by performing non-multiplicative prolongations and multiplicative reductions. Every specific involutive division generates a particular form of involutive computational procedure. In addition to three involutive divisions used by Thomas, Janet and Pommaret for analysis of partial differential equations we define two new ones. These two divisions, as well as Thomas division, do not depend on the order of variables. We prove noetherity, continuity and constructivity of the new divisions that provides correctness and termination of involutive algorithms for any finite set of input polynomials and any admissible monomial ordering. We show that, given an admissible monomial ordering, a monic minimal involutive basis is uniquely defined and thereby can be considered as canonical much like the reduced Gröbner basis.},

  Abstract                 = { The investigation of the problem of integrability of polynomial-nonlinear evolution equations, in particular, verifying the existence of the higher symmetries and conservation laws can often be reduced to the problem of finding the exact solution of a complicated system of nonlinear algebraic equations. It is remarkable that these algebraic equations can be not only obtained completely automatically by computer [1] but also often not only completely solved by computer, in spite of their complicated structure and often infinitely many solutions. We demonstrate this fact using the Groebner basis method [2] and obtain all (infinitely many) solutions of the systems of algebraic equations which are equivalent to integrability of three different multiparametric families of NLEEs [1]: the seventh order scalar KdV-like equations, the seventh order MKdV-like equations, and the third order coupled KdV-like systems. All our computations have been carried out by using the computer algebra system REDUCE (version 3.2) on an IBM PC AT-like computer. Because of the fact that the computer algebra system REDUCE 3.2 (in particular on IBM PC, and unlike REDUCE 3.3), has no built-in package for computation of Groebner basis, we have written our own program in Rlisp in order to solve systems of algebraic equations using Buchberger's algorithm [2]. To make the program effecient we have used the distributive form for the internal representation of polynomials together with multivariate factorization. In order to obtain the (infinitely many) solutions, we construct a lexicographic Groebner basis, then we compute, according to [3], the dimension and independent sets of variables for the ideal which is generated by the input system. Thereafter, we consider each set of variables as free parameters and compute a Groebner basis leaving the order of the others unchanged. As a result we obtain a set of Groebner bases with a simple structure, and the solution can be found in an easy way. Our analysis shows that the Groebner basis method allows us to obtain the complete set of exact solutions for systems of nonlinear algebraic equations which are the necessary integrability conditions for NLEEs and therefore to select all integrable evolution equations. It is clear that the solvability of the above systems and of even more complicated ones is closely connected with the property of integrability. In addition to their importance in the theory and application of NLEEs, such systems are very useful for testing different computer algebra algorithms. One of our system is in a list of examples for Groebner basis computations [4].},

  Abstract                 = {We use the symmetry approach to establish an efficient program in REDUCE for verifying necessary integrability conditions for polynomial-nonlinear evolution equations and systems in one-spatial and one-temporal dimensions. These conditions follow from the existence of higher infinitesimal symmetries and conservation law densities. We briefly consider the mathematical background of the symmetry approach to the problem of integrability. In the description of our algorithms and their implementation in REDUCE we present in particular the basic algorithm for reversing the operator of the total derivative with respect to the spatial variable. One of the most interesting application of the present program is the problem of classification when the complete list of integrable equations from a given multiparametric family is needed. In this case the program generates necessary integrability conditions in form of a system of nonlinear algebraic equations in the parameters present in the initial equations. In spite of their often complicated structure, there are systems for which the solution can be found in exact form by applying the technique of Groebner basis. We present three examples of evolution equations for which this system can in fact be solved.},

The important feature of the system is that the human user has the opportunity and obligation to help actively in the simplifying and proving. The user, for example, is the primary source of problem domain facts and properties needed in the proofs. A general description is given of the overall design philosophy, structure, and functional components of the system, and a simple sorting program is used to illustrate both the behavior of major system components and the type of user interaction the system provides.},

  Comment                  = {Winkler (1988) and Pauer (1992) present algorithms for a Hensel lifting of a modular Gr{\"o}bner basis over lucky primes to a rational one. They have to solve a linear system with modular polynomial entries that requires another (modular) Gr{\"o}ner basis computation. After an extension of luckiness to arbitrary (commutative noetherian) base rings we show in this paper that for a homogeneous polynomial ideal I one lift not only only its Gr{\"o}bner basis but also a homogeneous basis of its syzygy module. The same result holds for arbitrary ideals and liftings from Z/p to Q. Moreover the same lifting can be obtained from a true Gro{\"o}bner trace by linear algebra over Q only. Parallel modular techniques allow to find such a true Gro{\"o}bner and a lucky prime with high probability. All these results generalize in an obvious way to homogeneous modules generated by the rows of matrices with polynomial entries. Since luckiness can be weakened to a condition that transfers from I to higher syzygy modules the lifting theorem generalizes to a lifting theorem for the resolution of I.},

The double optical resonance spectrum is identical for both models and therefore double optical resonance experiments cannot distinguish between them. The importance of transients in cases where the laser bandwidth is comparable with or less than the atomic linewidth is stressed. Experiments which can distinguish between the two sources of bandwidth are identified.},

Using the asymptotic behavior of the electromagnetic form factors of the hadrons, predictions are made for the energy and angular dependence of a large number of processes. Detailed numerical comparisons with experiment are given for several reactions. A general discussion of the qualitative behavior of large-angle quasi-two-body processes is given.

  Abstract                 = {A formalism for handling the scattering of composite systems is presented. Using this formalism, the contribution to bound state scattering at large energy and angle from the interchange force is calculated. This force leads to elastic cross sections which behave at fixed angle like the sixth power of the form factor and for which $(d\sigma/dt)/(d\sigma/dt)_{90^{\circ}}$ is an energy independent function of z. Comparison with p-p and π-p data shows excellent agreement. A new test of the existence of a pointlike coupling of the photon to partons is suggested.},

This ansatz is motivated by the known analytic result for the Higgs decay rate into two photons. The method also allows us to check this result and to extend it to the pseudo-scalar decay rate.},

  Abstract                 = {Algebraic computation systems produce results for either human or machine consumption. In the latter case, numerical evaluation of the resulting expressions is often the goal. In either case, it is important to produce results in an appropriately optimal form. In this paper, we consider some of the methods available for doing this. In particular, we shall see that several of our techniques mirror the methods used by human experts. In addition, we shall mention some new algorithms that promise to make the whole problem more tractable mathematically.},

  Abstract                 = {Most algebraic computations which arise from physical problems have considerable structure in their specification because of the many physical conservation laws and the nature of our approximation techniques. The exploitation of this structure is often the reason why hand calculations of non-trivial problems are possible. However, most available algebra systems do not preserve such structure in a consistent manner, and consequently produce results which are far less comprehensible than equivalent hand calculations. In this paper we shall describe techniques which can utilize the algebraic structure more effectively and apply them to several examples.}

As a nontrivial example we discuss a metric of PlebaImage ski & DemiaImage ski (of Petrov type D) together with an electromagnetic potential and a triplet of post-Riemannian one-forms. This whole geometrical construct represents an exact solution of a metric-affine gauge theory of gravity. We describe a sample session and verify by computer that this exact solution fulfills the appropriate field equations. — Computer programs are described for the irreducible decomposition of (non-Riemannian) curvature, torsion, and nonmetricity.},

The program implements high-quality typesetting algorithms and TEX fonts, which allow the user to produce professionally looking documents.The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically generated formulae, which makes TeXmacs suitable as an interface for computer algebra systems, or other types of "plugins". Currently, there are interfaces with Axiom, Giac, GNUplot, Graphviz, Gtybalt, Macaulay2, Maxima, Mupad, GNU Octave, Pari, Qcl, GNU R, Reduce, Scilab and Yacas. TeXmacs also supports the Guile/Scheme extension language, so that you may customize the interface and write your own extensions to the editor.In our demonstration, we plan to show briefly how to edit mathematical texts with TeXmacs, how to use computer algebra systems, and how to add interfaces with new systems in a very efficient way.},

  Abstract                 = {A theoretical method, developed in a previous paper, enables one to calculate analytical expressions for time-varying voltages at specific locations in branching dendritic systems in response to synaptic current inputs at other sites. Exact results were obtained for a number of dendritic trees that possessed certain symmetries: all branch lengths had to be integral multiples of one another, and all branch diameters had to be equal. Because the second of these conditions is unrealistic, the method has been generalized to treat dendritic trees whose branches differ in diameter. The method entails adding onto the symmetric results a sum of correction terms. It is found that the correction terms, as well as the symmetric results, can be expressed as combinations of two families of functions. These functions, generalizations of those found in our earlier paper, provide a precise formalism for analyzing how voltage transients depend on the geometrical structure of the dendritic tree. Examples are given that show how the correction terms affect the value of the voltage, and how variations in branch diameters alter the behavior of the propagated postsynaptic potential. The implications of these results for our understanding of neuronal functioning are discussed.},

Ingredients for the method are some concepts of interval arithmetic and a slightly modified precision notion, in both absolute and relative sense. This allows to take second order effects into account and to consider errors as a combination of inevitable propagated errors, due to inaccurate input, and controlable generated errors, due to arithmetic operations. The error control allows to consider these operations as adjustable sources and results in a set of instructions for using the Sasaki-package such that the precision, dictated by the analysis, guarantees to limit error cumulation to admissible, user chosen error bounds.},

Raising and answering this question are equally controversial, since a clear distinction between languages features and library facilities is hard to make. Instead of even attempting to answer this rather academic question it is argued why it is reasonable to raise related questions: Is SMP a paradox? Is it realistic to neglect inaccurate input data? Is a very high level programming language instrumental for equal opportunity employment in scientific research?},

  Abstract                 = {Resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is described by a set of eight coupled, nonlinear, three-dimensional, time-dependent, partial differential equations. A computer code, IMP (Implicit MHD Program), has been developed to solve these equations numerically by the method of finite differences on an Eulerian mesh. In this model, the equations are expressed in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, making the code applicable to a variety of coordinate systems. The Douglas-Gunn algorithm for Alternating-Direction Implicit (ADI) temporal advancement is used to avoid the limitations in timestep size imposed by explicit methods. The equations are solved simultaneously to avoid syncronization errors. While the continuity and magnetic flux equations are expressed as conservation laws, the momentum and energy equations are nonconservative. This is to: (1) provide enhanced numerical stabillity by eliminating errors introduced by the nonvanishing of $\nabla \bullet B$ on the finite difference mesh; and, (2) allow the simulation of low $\beta$ plasmas. To allow for general simulations, the boundary conditions may be Dirichlet, Neumann, or periodic. A conservation boundary condition based on the physical properties of the wall is presented. The resulting finite difference equations are a coupled system of nonlinear algebraic equations which are solved by the Newton-Raphson iteration technique.
We apply our model to a number of problems of importance in magnetic fusion research. Ideal and resistive internal kink instabilities are simulated in a Cartesian geometry. Growth rates and nonlinear saturation amplitudes are found to be in agreement with previous analytic and numerical predictions. We also simulate these instabilities in a square cross section torus. This demonstrates the versatility of the orthogonal curvilinear coordinate representation employed by our model. In both geometries, long time simulations in resistive plasmas display final states with finite flow fields. Finally, we perform a simulation of the spontaneous field reversal in a high current pinch. In this case, relaxation to a field reversed geometry is demonstrated both for a plasma that initially has a high pinch ratio $(B_\odot/B_{z} > 1.6)$, and for one that initially has a low pinch ratio and is subjected to an external electric field to increase the internal current. In these final Reversed Field Pinch (REP) cases, we find that the resistive internal kink is the mechanism which causes the field reversal.},

Such approach permits us to simplify the tensor expressions possessing symmetry properties, summation (dummy) indices and multiterm identities by unify manner. The canonical element for the tensor expression is defined in terms of the basic vectors of this linear space. The main restriction of the algorithm is the dimension of the linear space that is equal to N!, where N is a number of indices of the tensor expression. The program uses REDUCE as user interface.},

The sequential-flip dynamics of {\em n}-site chain has the same correlation time as the {\em n}-sublattice dynamics. The relaxation becomes slow when this {\em n} is made large. The static models equivalent to these dynamic models are the Ising models on a triangular lattice with a skew boundary condition which has the same couplings in two directions.

  Abstract                 = {Two kinds of multi-spin-flip discrete-time dynamics of the Ising chain are solved analytically. One dynamics is the two sublattice type flip and each sublattice contains {\em n} sequential spins alternately. The other has the overlapped multi-spin-flip sequence. The state of {\em n} spins at the next time step is selected from ${2}^{n}$ states using the heat-bath type transition probability. These dynamics of the Ising chain are equivalent to the statics of the square-lattice Ising model with a 1 x 2 unit cell or of the triangular-lattice Ising model. The analytic solutions of the single spin relaxation time of these dynamics are obtained using these equivalences.},

  Abstract                 = {The program package ACRITH (High-Accuracy Arithmetic Subroutine Library) provides FORTRAN subroutines for the solution of several standard mathematical problems. The routines use floating point operations with extended precision and interval arithmetic and are designated especially for the solution of ill-conditioned problems. Test results for most of the routines are presented with emphasis on the practical usability of the package. It turns out that not all routines are of equal high quality and reliability; in the documentation, hints to the implemented numerical algorithms are completely missing, and the error messages are not always concise. Some possible alternatives like symbolic algebra systems or multiple precision packages are mentioned.},

  Abstract                 = {A method for extracting the alignment parameters of a molecular angular momentum distribution using laser-induced fluorescence is presented. The treatment is applicable to the common case of cylindrically symmetric orientation distributions in the high-J limit. Four different combinations of rotational branches in the LIF absorption emission process are examined for experimental arrangements without external fields as well as with an applied strong magnetic field. Computer algebra programs are used to generate simple analytical expressions which account for the influence of saturation on determining alignment parameters. In this analysis saturation effects can be calculated without any prior knowledge of the orientational distribution. It is found that an exact treatment is necessary even at a relatively low saturation and in most cases it can be carried out with only a limited knowledge of the saturation conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {After determining the relationship between cylindrical and spherical solid vector harmonics, we arrive at the complete and effective solution for the static deformation due to a multipolar source of arbitrary order in a homogeneous isotropic half-space. Using the correpsondence between spherical harmonics and seismic moment tensors obtained earlier, we construct a catalog of mirror image sources which yield zero traction on the plane. For each angular order number l the total number of these images is 15 for a general case, of which the first spheroidal source has seven images, the toroidal source has four images, and the second spheroidal source also has four images. We derive the conditions under which image point sources are converted into semi-infinite line nuclei. We analyze several special cases of deformation in a half-space, namely, axisymmetric, generalized Boussinesq-Cerruti, thermoelastic deformations. We present several general and specific models of finite sources of elastic displacement in a half-space and discuss possibilities for inverting complex extended sources of elastic deformation. The nonuniqueness of the inversion can be estimated objectively.},

If a complex earthquake is assumed to be a set of individual, randomly oriented elementary pure double couple sources, the solution for the seismic moment of the complex event projected on the mean trend of the fault will perforce be comprised of sources of both double couple and compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) types. We investigate the statistical properties of these two components of seismic sources in terms of the invariants of the seismic moment tensor of a realistic set of synthetic earthquakes. It is very likely that the size of the CLVD component is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the double couple component.},

  Abstract                 = {The efficiency of evaluation is investigated on two "big-float" systems, our LISP-interpreter-based system and Brent's FORTRAN-compiler-based system. The test problems are computations of constants e and pi, and functions sqrt(x) and exp(x). We found that speeds of big-float addition, subtraction and multiplication on our LISP-based system are nearly the same as or rather faster than those on the FORTRAN-based system. This high efficiency of basic arithmetic operations in our system is essentially due to the efficient big-integer routines in a host LISP-system written in an assembly language. Evaluation speeds of the test problems themselves on the LISP-based system are, on an average, 1.5 times slower than those on the FORTRAN-based system. The ratio of the evaluation speeds depends, however, very much on how the routines of test problems are programmed. Therefore, we conclude that the speed of a LISP-based big-float system can be reduced to within two times of that of a FORTRAN-based system.},

When a FORTRAN source code for the integrand is produced by REDUCE, often it is not only too long but is not enough reduced to be optimized by a FORTRAN compiler. A program package called SPROC has been developed to convert FORTRAN source code to a more optimized form and to divide the code into subroutines whose lengths are short enough for FORTRAN compilers. It can also generate a vectorizable code, which can achieve high efficiency of vector computers. The output is given in a suitable form for the numerical integration package BASES and its vector computer version VBASES. By this improvement the CPU-time for integration is shortened by a factor of about two on a scalar computer and of several times then on a vector computer.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements by the Belle Collaboration of the exclusive production of two charmonia in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation differ substantially from theoretical predictions. Till now, no conclusive explanation for this remarkable discrepancy has been provided. Even the origin of the discrepancy is not identified, yet. We suggest that the measurement of four-charm events in Belle data must provide a strong constraint in identifying the origin of this large discrepancy. Our prediction of the cross section for $e^{+}e^{-}\to c\overline{c} c\overline{c}$ , in lowest order in strong coupling constant, at sqrt[s]=10.6  GeV is about 0.1   pb. If measured four-charm cross section is compatible with the prediction based on perturbative QCD, it is very likely that factorization of the hadronization process from perturbative part may be significantly violated or there exists a new production mechanism. If the cross section for the four-charm event is also larger than the prediction like that for the exclusive $J/\ψ+\eta_{c}$ production, perturbative QCD expansion itself will be proved to be unreliable and loses predictive power.},

The theory is based on the assumption that the system of equations supports permanently rotating spiral solutions, and from this assumptions equations governing the motion of the scroll wave filament can be derived. Then, bifurcatilon theory is used to show that the equations of motion have torus knots as invariant solutions. Analytical methods are used to determine qualitative and quantitative features of these knotted solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {A food chain model with two predators feeding on a single prey in a chemostat is studied. Using a multiparameter bifurcation analysis, we find parameters values for which there is stable oscillatory coexistence of the predators. It is also shown how these coexistent states provide a transition between two possible states of competitive exclusion. It is shown that the competitive exclusion principle need not hold if one or more of the predators has oscillatory behavior in the absence of other predators.},

  Abstract                 = {A conformal change of metric is used to construct a coupling of two time-changed Riemannian Brownian motions, such that there is an upper bound on the prabability of no coupling before either process leaves a small geodesic ball, with the bound being linear in the distance between the two starting points. This coupling is a more geometric (and probabilistically less technical) alternative to that introduced by Cranston (1991). Together with some modifications it is used to provide a probabilistic approach to the regularity of harmonic maps, thus completing the probabilistic construction of solutions to small-image harmonic map Dirichlet problems described in Kendall (1990). The approach includes a mild generalization to the case of harmonic maps defined using non-Riemannian connections in the target manifold and smooth strictly elliptic second-order differential operators in the domain.}

In addition, expressions for third and fourth moments are derived for the special case of equal diffusion coefficients, equal rate constants, and equal but opposite velocities. The initial conditions are arbitrary amounts of A or B concentrated in an infinitesimally narrow region. The moments are computed from derivatives of the Fourier-transformed concentration profiles of A and B. The moments are used in an expansion in term of Hermite polynomials, the Gram-Charlier expansion, to construct the concentration profiles of A or B or A and B together. The examples presented show that a few terms of the expansion, for which explicit expressions are given, can give tolerable accuracy if the velocity is not too large and the rate constants and diffusion coefficient are not too small. The expansion can be used to determine when the profiles are unimodal.},

A fermionic extension of the Burgers equation is related with the Burgers flows on associative algebras. A Gardner's deformation is found for the bosonic super-field dispersionless Boussinesq equation, and unusual properties of a recursion operator for its Hamiltonian symmetries are described. Also, we construct a three-parametric supersymmetric system that incorporates the Boussinesq equation with dispersion and dissipation but never retracts to it for any values of the parameters.},

The algorithm previously proposed by the authors for the case where the ideal is zero-dimensional and radical seems to have practical efficiency. We present a new method for solving systems which are not necessarily radical. The set of all solutions is partitioned into subsets each of which consists of mutually conjugate solutions having the same multiplicity.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article we present new results for families of orthogonal polynomials and special functions, that are determined by algorithmical approaches.
In the first section, we present new results, especially for discrete families of orthogonal polynomials, obtained by an application of the celebrated Zeilberger algorithm.
Next, we present algorithms for holonomic families $f(n,x)$ of special functions which possess a derivative rule. We call those families admissible. A family $f(n,x)$ is holonomic if it satisfies a holonomic recurrence equation with respect to n, and a holonomic differential equation with respect to x, i.e. linear homogeneous equations with polynomial coefficients.
The rather rigid property of admissibility has many interesting consequences, that can be used to generate and verify identities for these functions by linear algebra techniques. On the other hand, many families of special functions, in particular families of orthogonal polynomials, are admissible. We moreover present a method that generates the derivative rule from the holonomic representation of a holonomic family.
As examples, we find new identities for the Jacobi polynomials and for the Whittaker functions, and for families of discrete orthogonal polynomials by the given approach.
Finally, we present representations for the parameter derivatives of the Gegenbauer and the generalized Laguerre polynomials.}

  Abstract                 = {Spectral properties, as determined by trace maps, of the one-dimensional chains (layered structures) constructed according to general two-letter substitution rules are investigated. In all trace maps thus obtained an important role is played by the quantity $I=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-xyz-4$ However, only a very small fraction of all such trace maps are similar to the Fibonacci golden-mean trace map in that I is their invariant. In addition to the known case of the precious-mean lattices (precious means are ratios of the form $^{1}_{2}[m+(m^{2}+4)^{1/2}]$, m being any positive integer; m=1 gives the golden mean), we have identified two new large clases of substitution rules that give trace maps with invariant I. One of them is a superset of the precious-mean lattices. All other cases represent a vast assortment of different trace maps (and thus the potential for various hitherto unexplored spectral properties) with a unifying feature that the set I=0 plays the role of an attractor in the trace space. In most (but not all) cases, two chains with identical trace maps (and thus identical spectra) are locally isomorphic. Generally, local isomorphism equivalence classes seem to be subsets of identical spectrum equivalence classes.},

  Abstract                 = { The article deals with automation of the process of numerical solving of partial differential equations systems (PDES) by means of computer algebra. For solving PDES the finite difference method is applied. The computer algebra system REDUCE and the numerical programming language FORTRAN are used in the methodology presented, its main aim being to speed up the process of preparing numerical programs for solving PDES. Quite often, especially for complicated systems, this process is a tedious and time consuming task. In the process several stages can be found in which computer algebra can be used for performing routine analytical calculations, namely: transformation of differential equations into different coordinate systems, discretization of differential equations, analysis of difference schemes, and generation of numerical programs. The FIDE package consists of the following modules that have been built, tested, and documented: EXPRESS for transforming PDES into any orthogonal coordinate system. IIMET for discretization of PDES by integro-interpolation method. APPROX for determining the order of approximation of difference schemes. CHARPOL for calculating the amplification matrix and characteristic polynomial of difference schemes, which are needed in the Fourier stability analysis. HURWP for locating polynomial roots necessary in verifying the von Neumann stability condition. LINBAND for generating the block of FORTRAN code, which solves a system of linear algebraic equations with band matrix appearing frequently in difference schemes. The FIDE package is applied to two physical problems. The first one is the nonlinear Schr�dinger equation, which describes several physical phenomena, e.g. the Langmuir waves in plasma. The second one is the Fokker-Planck equation in diffusive approximation, which is used to describe the kinetics of electrons in plasma, including interactions of electrons with a laser beam through inverse bremsstrahlung. The numerical programs have been tested and compared with similar calculations published so far.},

  Abstract                 = {The support operator method designs mimetic finite difference schemes by first constructing a discrete divergence operator based on the divergence theorem, and then defining the discrete gradient operator as the adjoint operator of the divergence based on the Gauss theorem connecting the divergence and gradient operators, which remains valid also in the discrete case. When evaluating the discrete gradient operator, one needs to define discrete inner products of two discrete vector fields. The local discrete inner product on a given triangle is defined by a 3×3 symmetric positive definite matrix M defined by its six independent elements–parameters. Using the Gauss theorem over our triangle, we evaluate the discrete gradient in the triangle. We require the discrete gradient to be exact for linear functions, which gives us a system of linear equations for elements of the matrix M. This system, together with inequalities which guarantee positive definiteness of the matrix M, results in a one parameter family of inner products which give exact gradients for linear functions. The traditional inner product is a member of this family. The positive free parameter can be used to improve another property of the discrete method. We show that accuracy of the method for quadratic functions improves with decreasing this parameter, however, at the same time, the condition number of the matrix M, which is the local matrix of the linear system for computing the discrete gradient, increases to infinity when the parameter goes to zero, so one needs to choose a compromise between accuracy and solvability of the local system. Our analysis has been performed by computer algebra tools which proved to be essential.},

We show this by means of some examples of one-dimensional shallow water flow over an obstacle. In two dimensions we present a new version of Lax--Friedrichs and an associated second order predictor-corrector method. Composition of these schemes is shown to be effective and efficient for some two-dimensional Riemann problems and for Noh's infinite strength cylindrical shock problem. We also show comparable results for composition of the predictor-corrector scheme with a modified second order accurate weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) scheme. That composition is second order but is more efficient and has better symmetry properties than WENO alone. For scalar advection in two dimensions the optimal stability of the new predictor-corrector scheme is shown using computer algebra. We also show that the generalization of this scheme to three dimensions is unstable, but by using sampling we are able to show that the composites are suboptimally stable.},

  Abstract                 = {Vertical averaging of the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations leads to several reduced dimension models of flow over topography, including the one-layer and two-layer classic shallow water equations, and the one-layer and two-layer nonhydrostatic Green–Naghdi equations. These equations are derived and their well-posedness is discussed. Several implicit and explicit finite difference approximations of both the shallow water and Green–Naghdi models are presented, but for Green–Naghdi these are obtained using automatic code generation software. Numerical results are given in both well-posed and ill-posed regimes and compared with computations obtained by others.},

The further methods to be used include: for first-order equations, an adaptation of Shtokhamer's [1] MACSYMA program based on the results of Prelle and Singer [2]; for higher-order linear equations, factorisation of the operator where possible, and use of methods following results of Singer [3,4] and others; and for non-linear equations, the exploitation of Lie symmetries.},

We directly derive the 1D discrete numerical model from the 2D advective and diffusive dynamics for the evolution of the contaminant. The holistic discretisation of the 2D advection-diffusion equation is placed within the purview of centre manifold theory by dividing the physical domain into rectangular 2D elements through introducing artificial insulating boundaries which are later removed. The resulting holistic discretisation is consistent with the 1D Taylor model for shear dispersion in the channel. This new technique accurately models the subgrid scale processes and provides a direct link between the 1D numerical discretisation and the original 2D physical dynamics. Centre manifold theory also systematically incorporates the physical inlet and outlet conditions into the 1D discretisation. This method is straightforwardly extended to nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations and more complex geometries.},

  Abstract                 = {I analyse a generalised Burgers' equation to introduce a new method of spatial discretisation. The analysis is based upon centre manifold theory so we are assured that the discretisation accurately models the dynamics and may be constructed systematically. The trick to the application of centre manifold theory is to divide the physical domain into small elements by introducing insulating internal boundaries which are later removed. Burgers' equation is used as an example to show how the concepts work in practise. The resulting finite difference models are shown to be significantly more accurate than conventional discretisations, particularly for highly nonlinear dynamics. This centre manifold approach treats the dynamical equations as a whole, not just as the sum of separate terms---it is holistic. The techniques developed here may be used to accurately model the nonlinear evolution of quite general spatio-temporal dynamical systems.},

The test pool is based on Kamke's collection of first order and first degree ODEs.

A brief survey of existing mostly resultant-based dispersion algorithms is given and the complexity of the resultant involved is analysed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm applied to indefinite summation is demonstrated by some examples that are not easily summed by the standard facilities in several computer algebra systems.},

Two of them represent stiff fluids with the density equal to the pressure. A third family satisfies an equation of state of the linear type $p=\gamma\rho$. Regarding the fourth family we can integrate the field equations so that there only remains an ordinary differential equation for an unknown to be solved. We also give some explicit particular solutions in this case. The fifth family contains an explicit singularity-free stiff fluid solution which has already been studied by Mars in 1995 and an explicit singularity-free family satisfying the dominant energy condition (but not the strong energy condition) and which is eternally expanding and contracting without passing any big bang or big crunch.},

The three-dimensional conformal group is restricted to the case when the two-dimensional Abelian isometry subalgebra is an ideal and it is also assumed to act on non-null hypersurfaces (both spacelike and timelike cases are studied). We consider both diagonal and non-diagonal metrics, and find all the perfect-fluid solutions under these assumptions (except those already known). We find four families of solutions, each one containing arbitrary parameters for which no differential equations remain to be integrated. We write the line-elements in a simplified form and perform a detailed study for each of these solutions, giving the kinematical quantities of the fluid velocity vector, the energy density and pressure, values of the parameters for which the energy conditions are fulfilled everywhere, the Petrov type, the singularities in the spacetimes and the Friedmann - Lemaître - Robertson - Walker metrics contained in each family.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new application of computer algebra to the treatment of steady states of reaction systems. The method is based on the Buchberger algorithm. This algorithm was modified so that it can exploit the special structure of the equations derived from reaction systems, lareven large systems can be handled. In contrast to numerical approximation techniques, the algebraic solution gives a complete and definite overview of the solution space and it is even applicable when parameter values are unknown or undetermined. The algorithm, its adaptation to the problem class, and its application to selected examples are presented.},

The derivation uses centre manifold theory, which provides a systematic and near rigorous approach to calculating each successive approximation. It also enables the derivation of the correct initial conditions for the Taylor model of shear dispersion. Approximations that are valid when the channel is of a varying cross section are systematically derived via this approach, and the effects of time-dependent flow and variable diffusivity are also investigated. The resultant modifications to the effective advection velocity and the effective dispersion coefficient are calculated and some general trends indicated.},

  Abstract                 = {Head-on collision of two (KdV) solitary waves at the interface of an inviscid two-fluid system of rigid upper and lower boundaries is investigated by a perturbation method. We obtain the third-order solution and find a dispersive wavetrain trailing behind each emerging solitary wave. The wavetrain is of the same polarity (depression/elevation) as the main wave. Furthermore, the energy and amplitude of the wave-train are decreasing in time as long as it is still attached to the main wave. This implies an increase in energy of the main wave. Up to the third order of accuracy the solitary wave emerging from a head-on collision retains its initial profile save for a phase shift. This phase shift is found to be amplitude dependent to the second order. The transfer of energy from the wavetrain to the main wave explains the slow recovery of the incident profiles in existing numerical results on the head-on collision of two solitary waves at the surface of an infinite channel.},

This note relates my progress towards solving the problem using REDUCE: at present the programs involved are not as tidy as those displayed (for instance) in the MACSYMA or SCRATCHPAD solutions, and the computing times still leave scope for improvement. The results are nevertheless there, and the extensions to REDUCE that I have made in the process of obtaining them give a clear demonstration of the amount of mechanism called into play by 'modern' algebra such as factorization. The solution of problem 7 splits naturally into three parts. The first of these calculates a pair of modest polynomials P and Q. This does not give REDUCE any trouble at all.},

  Abstract                 = { In 1976 Risch [1] proposed a scheme for finding the integrals of forms built up out of transcendental functions that viewed general functions as rational forms in a suitable differential field and represented the polynomial parts of those forms in a distributed rather than recursive way. By using a data representation where all variables were (more or less) equally important this new method seemed to side-step some of the complications that had appeared in his previous scheme [2] where various side-constraints had to be propagated between the levels present in a tower of separate extensions of differential fields, otherwise seen as levels in recursive datastructures. An initial implementation of the method was prepared in the context of the SCRATCHPAD/1 algebra system and demonstrated at the 1976 SYMSAC meeting at Yorktown Heights, a subsequent version for Reduce [3][5] came after that, and made it possible to try the method on a large range of integrals. These practical studies showed up some problems with the method and its implementation. The presentation given here re-expresses the 1976 Risch method in terms of rewrite rules, and thus exposes the major problem it suffers from as a manifestation of the fact that in certain circumstances the set of rewrites generated is not confluent. This difficulty is then attacked using a critical-pair/completion (CPC) approach. For very many integrands it is then easy to see that the initial set of rewrites used in the early implementations [1] and [3] do not need any extension, and this fact explains the high level of competence of the programs involved despite their shaky theoretical foundations. For a further large collection of problems even a simple CPC scheme converges rapidly; when the techniques presented here are applied to the REDUCE integration test suite in all applicable cases a short computation succeeds in completing the set of rewrites and hence gives a secure basis for testing for integrability. This paper describes the implementation of the CPC process and discusses current limitations to and possible future extended applications of it.},

  Abstract                 = {The {CSL} Lisp system is one designed primarily for delivering Lisp applications to users. It thus emphasises robustness, portability and small size rather than support for an integrated programming environment. Both portability and compactness are served by making CSL compile the bulk of applications code into a compact byte-code instruction set which is then emulated. The speed penalities inherent in this are offset by providing instrumentation that makes it easy to identify code hot-spots, and a second compiler that translates critical parts of the original Lisp into C for incorporation in the CSL kernel. For use with REDUCE it is found that compiling about 5% of the source code into C led to overall performance competetive with other Lisp implementations.},

At that time it would have been possible to claim that all the major barriers in the way of a complete system for automated analysis had been breached.

  Abstract                 = {Using the Boussinesq approximation for a fluid of low Prandtl number, a low dimensional model of the onset of Rayleigh-Benard convection is developed. The initial roll mode instability is considered for a fluid, heated from below, between parallel, horizontal, non-slip, constant-temperature boundaries. Centre manifold theory provides a way of constructing a low dimensional model of the resulting two dimensional flow. Computer algebra implemented in reduce is used to symbolically expand the centre manifold as an asymptotic series in the convective amplitude. The spatial structure functions in this expansion are then found numerically in Matlab. A feature of this approach is that code output from reduce is used, with only minor syntactic editing, as the Matlab code to perform the numerical iteration. Thus a coding task which would have been difficult by hand is easily automated. The technique is generally applicable to perturbation expansions and its computational advantages over more formal Galerkin type expansions are discussed.},

In the first one we utilize only superfermions while in the second only superbosons and in the third superbosons as well superfermions. It is shown that many soliton equations can be embedded in the supersymmetry theory by using the first approach even if we do not change these equations in the bosonic limit of the supersymmetry. In the second or third approach we obtain a generalization of the soliton equations in the bosonic limit which remains in the class of the usual commuting functions. As a byproduct of our analysis we prove that for the first procedure the bosonic part of the one-component sypersymmetric KP hierachy coincides with the usual classical two-component KP hierarchy.},

This allows the manipulation of correct expressions of the basic relationships, as the strain-displacement one, without introducing any simplifying assumption or restriction. The perturbation equations are automatically generated and a solution procedure leads to parametric expressions for the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of the bifurcated path.

As a first step we here consider a small domain and apply stochastic centre manifold techniques to derive a model. The approach automatically parametrises the subgrid scale processes induced by spatially distributed stochastic noise. It is important to discretise stochastic partial differential equations carefully, as we do here, because of the sometimes subtle effects of noise processes. In particular we see how stochastic resonance effectively extracts new noise processes for the model which in this example helps stabilise the zero solution.},

Burgers' equation is used as an example to show how the concepts work in practise. The resulting finite difference models are shown to be significantly more accurate than conventional discretisations, particularly for highly nonlinear dynamics. This centre manifold approach treats the dynamical equations as a whole, not just as the sum of separate terms---it is holistic.

Centre manifold theory provides a systematic basis for the reduction of dimensionality from some detailed dynamical prescription down to a relatively simple model. An initial condition for the detailed dynamics also has to be projected onto the low-dimensional model, but except in meteorology this issue has received scant attention. Herein, based upon the algorithm in~\cite{Roberts96a}, I develop a straightforward algorithm for the computer algebra derivation of this projection. The method is systematic and is based upon the geometric picture underlying centre manifold theory. The method is applied to examples of a pitchfork and a Hopf bifurcation. There is a close relationship between this projection of initial conditions and the correct projection of forcing onto a model.

  Abstract                 = {A possible way of developing computer algebra systems is an "education" of the system. By "education" we mean here supplying the system with the capacity for handling new classes of mathematical objects. Tensors or, more generally, functions of several variables are an examples of such objects of practical interest. The main features of these objects which makes nontrivial the problem of incorporating them into a computer algebra system, are the symmetry properties exhibited by tensors (functions) we meet in practice. The simplification of expressions containg tensor monomials involves two operations: monomial identification and monomial pattern matching. The tensor identification problem when dummy summation indices are included and the tensor pattern matching problem when the pattern has free variables may both be reformulated as combinatorial problems. The first one is reducible to the double coset problem for the permutation group and the second, to a variant of the general combinatorial object isomorphism problem. The backtrack algorithms for solving the above two problems are based on some well-known ideas in computational group theory. A recursive variant of the tensor identification algorithm for a restricted class of symmetry groups and the algorithm implementation are discussed briefly.},

The explicit expression of the equations, obtained with the help of EXCALC2, is given here for two nondiagonal five-dimensional spatially homogeneous models, namely $G_{1}$ and $G_{8}$. These equations constitute an ideal tool for the study of the dynamics of these models: an oscillatory behavior has been found for model $G_{1}$, while model $G_{8}$ exhibits a monotonous kasnerian mode of approach to the initial singularity.},

We derive the lubrication model of the dynamics of the film expressed in terms of the film thickness. The comprehensive model accurately includes the effects of the curvature of the substrate, via a physical multiple-scale approach, and gravity and inertia, via more rigorous centre manifold techniques. This new approach theoretically supports the use of the model over a wide range of parameters and provides a sound basis for further development of lubrication models. Numerical simulations exhibit some generic features of the dynamics of such thin fluid films on substrates with complex curvature: we here simulate a film thinning at a corner, the flow around a torus, and draining of a film down a cylinder. The last is more accurate than other lubrication models. The model derived here describes well thin film dynamics over a wide range of parameter regimes.},

The expression for the temperature response within the column as a function of time and axial position is obtained by expanding the solution to an impulse of heat at the inlet in terms of either Hermite or Laguerre polynomials. The response to an arbitrary inlet temperature transient, found via a convolution integral, is expressed as a single quadrature. The response to a step input is an algebraic expression.},

The basic design principles of this package are first, it is as efficient as possible in both calculation speed and memory usage, second, even a casual user can use it, and third, it is highly portable and extensible. Our idea to attain the first property is to represent the arbitrary precision real number in as short a form as possible and to handle the precision in a much more flexible manner than any other similar system. A comparison is made of our scheme with a conventional one which uses a global precision, verifying the efficiency of our scheme. Our package contains two sets of routines for elementary arithmetic operations such as addition or multiplication. An expert user can write efficient programs using the first set of routines, while a casual user may use the second set of routines with less programming effort. Our package will become faster by rewriting only four basic and simple routines machine-dependently.},

  Abstract                 = {The numerical solution of optimal control problems by indirect methods (such as multiple shooting or collocation) requires a considerable amount of analytic calculation to establish a numerically tractable system. These analytic calculations, though being rather tedious in realistic examples, are nowadays mostly still done by hand--and thus prone to calculation errors. The paper aims at automating this analytic processing to a reasonable extent by means of a modern symbolic manipulation language (here: REDUCE). In its present stage of development the package OCCAL (mnemotechnically for Optimal Control CALculator) permits an interactive use, covering tasks like automatic determination of control and, in case of a singular control, of its order. In simpler problems, the present version of OCCAL automatically produces the full subroutine input for a MULtiple shooting code (MULCON) with adaptive numerical CONtinuation.
In more complicated problems where singular sub-arcs may occur or where the sequence of sub-arcs of the optimal trajectory is unclear OCCAL is a significant help in reducing analytic pre-processing. Examples illustrate the performance of OCCAL/MULCON.},

  Abstract                 = {Factorization and testing for irreducibility has turned out to be one of the most important algorithms for handling linear ode's. The main hindrance for applying it is its trmendous complexity originating to a large extent from solving certain Riccati equations which occur during the factorization. The solution procedure for these Riccati equations is much more manageable if it is subdivided into two major parts. At first so called solution candidates are determined each of which depends only on the parameters of a single irreducible denominator or the behavior at infinity. In a second step it is tried to complete each candidate into a genuine solution of the Riccati equation, possibly including an unspecified number of additional first order poles. Furthermore a scheme is proposed for running the factorization procedure in parallel on a two-processor machine in which possible factors are searched for both from the right and the left at the same time.},

  Abstract                 = {The topic of this article is the symmetry analysis of differential equations and the applications of computer algebra to the extensive analytical calculations which are usually involved in it. The whole area naturally decomposes into two parts depending on whether ordinary or partial differential equations are considered. We show how a symmetry may be applied to lower the order of an ordinary differential equation or to obtain similarity solutions of partial differential equations. The computer algebra packages SODS and SPDE, respectively, which have been developed to perform almost all algebraic manipulations necessary to determine the symmetry group of a given differential equation, are presented. Furthermore it is argued that the application of computer algebra systems has qualitatively changed this area of applied mathematics.},

  Abstract                 = {The requirements of analyticity, crossing symmetry and unitarity (ACU) are used as input to construct amplitudes for the scattering of neutral $\pi$ mesons. They are obtained explicitly as polynomials in certain conformally transformed variables which ensure the correct analyticity structure. Crossing symmetry is expressed as a set of linear relations between the expansion coefficients. The same is true for the threshold behaviour of the partial waves and the behaviour for large energies of either the partial waves and the amplitudes itself. To enforce the positivity of the partial waves (up to a certain l) a new set of variables is introduced. It is obtained by solving the system of linear inequalities expressing the positivity condition. In this way one gets explicit expressions for all amplitudes satisfying the ACU requirements to some approximation. The rigorous constraints obtained from these ACU requirements are used to test the accuracy of this construction. The properties of all amplitudes are investigated in detail. It is indicated how this approximation scheme may be improved to any degree of accuracy and how it may be generalized to the full isospin case.},

The discrete potential along with the missing eigenvalues is found by solving a polynomial system of equations, which is derived and solved using the REDUCE computer algebra system. To ensure the convergence of the iterative process implemented in the Numeric package in REDUCE, proper initial data must be specified. The prescribed eigenvalues are perturbed original eigenvalues corresponding to the zero discrete potential. The original eigenvalues provide the natural initial data for the corresponding missing eigenvalues. In the case of a square, there are many multiple eigenvalues among the original eigenvalues. The direct application of the variant of the Newton method implemented in the Numeric package in REDUCE is impossible in the case of multiple initial data. A modification of the method proposed earlier for calculating the discrete potential of the two-dimensional discrete Schrdinger equation in a square is illustrated by an example.},

Using additionally symmetry properties, we reduce the problem to solution of two polynomial equations only $P(x,y) = 0, \c{O}(x,y) = 0$. In general case we can't calculate with our PC resources resultant of $P, \c{0}$. But for separate practically interesting parameter values the stability of considered problem is studied completely.

  Abstract                 = {The problem of stability of the triangular libration points in the planar circular restricted three-body problem is considered. A software package, intended for normalization of autonomous Hamiltonian systems by means of computer algebra, is designed so that normalization problems of high analytical complexity could be solved. It is used to obtain the Birkhoff normal form of the Hamiltonian in the given problem. The normalization is carried out up to the 6th order of expansion of the Hamiltonian in the coordinates and momenta. Analytical expressions for the coefficients of the normal form of the 6th order are derived. Though intermediary expressions occupy gigabytes of the computer memory, the obtained coefficients of the normal form are compact enough for presentation in typographic format. The analogue of the Deprit formula for the stability criterion is derived in the 6th order of normalization. The obtained floating-point numerical values for the normal form coefficients and the stability criterion confirm the results by Markeev (1969) and Coppola and Rand (1989), while the obtained analytical and exact numeric expressions confirm the results by Meyer and Schmidt (1986) and Schmidt (1989). The given computational problem is solved without constructing a specialized algebraic processor, i.e., the designed computer algebra package has a broad field of applicability.},

  Abstract                 = {The eighth moment of the magnitude of the trigonometric structure factor has been computed for all the space groups and all the reflection subsets giving rise to different functional forms of this quantity. This extension of previously published computations of lower moments permits the construction of four-term generalized distributions of normalized intensity, which are necessary in treating problems arising from highly heterogeneous atomic compositions in various space-group symmetries. The related problem of odd-even mixed partial moments of the trigonometric structure factor has also been investigated, and these mixed moments were found to vanish for all the three-dimensional space groups, confirming the correctness of the hitherto published theoretical statistics. Similar computations for the plane groups showed that non-zero values of the mixed partial odd-even moments are obtained for p3, p31m, p3ml, p6 and p6m. This result calls for some modifications of the statistical formalism to be applied to two-dimensional sets of intensity data. The modifications required for the centrosymmetric case are indicated in some detail.},

The system includes convenient facilities to generate (and solve) linear equations for electrical networks.The accompanying Code Optimizer is a general purpose tool to automatically optimize sets of algebraic expressions, with emphasis on those generated by the NETFORM system.Thus the combination of both systems can be used to solve numerous problems of a symbolic and/or numeric nature, taking full advantage of the REDUCE 2 embedding in which it is supported.For instance NETFORM can automatically provide a user with descriptive (tableau) equations of an arbitrary linear electrical network and, as it solves such linear equations too, calculate any transferfunction of that linear electrical network. The NETFORM environment encourages users to think of electrical networks in terms of network elements, one port elements as well as subnetworks, which can be conveniently described and manipulated.Given a complete network description, NETFORM allows different approaches in analyzing it, i.e. a full symbolic analysis, a hybrid analysis, a state analysis or a mixed hybrid and state analysis. },

  Abstract                 = {As a language for exchanging computer-"understandable" representations of mathematical formulas and concepts, OpenMath has a fairly standard syntactic structure for most of the mathematical notions that have so far been formalized in its "Content Dictionaries." The syntax for most operators is closely related to the well-known and decades-old LISP prefix notation for function application.For syntactic representations of a particular large class of mathematical operators, however, OpenMath takes a very unusual approach when compared with any of the existing Computer Algebra systems, say. This class contains integration and differentiation operators, sums and products, and other generalized quantifiers.In our paper we argue that OpenMath's novel approach to representing generalized quantifiers is superior to the classic representations. In particular, we show that this unusual feature of OpenMath has been designed to adhere to the Compositionality Principle[10], a design principle that classic representations, including older versions of OpenMath, have been violating[12].Having thus shown the importance of compositionality for the design of modern OpenMath, we then proceed to show that the Compositionality Principle is a fundamental research instrument in the Formal Semantics branch of linguistics[9], and argue that, like the use of this particular guiding principle for improvements in the design of a representation for generalized quantifiers, the study of the underlying structure of natural language as discovered by various branches of linguistics can provide many more suggestions for further improvements to OpenMath and to its sibling, MathML. We give some examples to substantiate our claim.},

The deviation of the primary flow from a parabolic profile influences the concentration field and this is investigated to complement previously known results. The long term evolution of the components of the sample is shown to be well described by a one-di\-men\-sion\-al advection-diffusion equation. The coefficients of this equation are determined by the rigorous analysis of the complete set of equations governing the two-dimensional fluid flow. This model gives quantitative predictions of the elution time of the samples, the width of the concentration pulse and the resolution of the apparatus. The influence of initial sample width and effects of the secondary relaxation from focusing to elution conditions are discussed. Reported theoretical predictions are in agreement with experimental results published previously.},

If it is possible to determine the coordinates of the points (i.e. the drawing is consistently dimensioned), then they are calculated. Otherwise the algorithm returns a flag specifying whether the drawing is underdimensioned or over-dimensioned. The method employes standard constructions from geometry such as the construction of a line from two distinct points or the construction of a line from a given line, a point and an angle. In order to determine whether some sequence of given constructions can be used to calculate the coordinates of each point we construct and analyse an undirected graph called the dimension graph of the drawing. If such a sequence exists, then the calculations are performed by calling symbolic routines which correspond to the various constructions. An implementation is described and examples are given.},

  Abstract                 = {We perform a classification of integrable systems of mixed scalar and vector evolution equations with respect to higher symmetries. We consider polynomial systems that are homogeneous under a suitable weighting of variables. This paper deals with the KdV weighting, the Burgers (or potential KdV or modified KdV) weighting, the Ibragimov–Shabat weighting and two unfamiliar weightings. The case of other weightings will be studied in a subsequent paper. Making an ansatz for undetermined coefficients and using a computer package for solving bilinear algebraic systems, we give the complete lists of second-order systems with a third-order or a fourth-order symmetry and third-order systems with a fifth-order symmetry. For all but a few systems in the lists, we show that the system (or, at least a subsystem of it) admits either a Lax representation or a linearizing transformation. A thorough comparison with recent work of Foursov and Olver is made.},

It has been demonstrated by the example of the generalized H\'{e}non-Heiles system that the use of the Laurent-series solutions of the initial differential equation assists to solve the obtained algebraic system and, thereby, simplifies the search for elliptic solutions. This procedure has been automatized with the help of the computer algebra systems Maple and REDUCE. The Laurent-series solutions also assist to solve the inverse problem: to prove the non-existence of elliptic solutions. Using the Hone's method based on the use the Laurent-series solutions and the residue theorem, we have proved that the cubic complex one-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equation has neither elliptic standing wave nor elliptic travelling wave solutions. To find solutions of the initial differential equation in the form of the Laurent series we use the Painlev\'{e} test.},

  Comment                  = {The ring of polynomials in $X,X_{1}, \dots ,X_{m}$ are denoted by $F_{p}[X,X_{1}, \dots ,X_{m}]$ in $F_{p}$, that is the field of integers defined modulo $p$. In the usual factorization algorithm defined by Wang, the given polynolmial $P$ is first factorized modulo $\Delta^{n}$, where $\Delta^{n}$ is an ideal. This algorithm uses a generalization of Hensel's Lemma. If there are no extraneous factors, then the factors defined modulo $\delta^[{n}$ correspond to the factors of $P$ in $F_{p}[X,X_{1}, \dots ,X_{m}]$ or else the defined factors must be regrouped to find the factors of $P$ in $F_{p}[X,X_{1}, \dots ,X_{m}]$. In this paper, a mapping that transforms the product of the factors into a sum is defined. A theorem that determines whether a subproduct of the factors of $P$ corresponds to a factor of $P$ in $F_{p}[X,X_{1}, \dots ,X_{m}]$ is given. Therefore the regrouping of the factors of $P$ reduces to solving a system of linear equations, as in the univariate case, with Berlekamp's algorithm.},

The dynamics may be modelled by Taylor's one-dimensional model of shear dispersion. We discuss the creation and utility of models of the dispersion of the dye, using invariant manifold theory. The models are effective exponentially quickly. We describe a one-mode centre manifold and a two-mode and a three-mode invariant manifold model. From the analysis, we decide under what conditions these three models are valid. Using the geometric picture provided by the theory of invariant manifolds, we find a complete set of initial conditions for the models so that the evolution of the full and approximate systems are identical after a short time. Throughout, a comparison of the three models is made to identify the practical situations when each model will be preferred.},

  Abstract                 = {In the introduction an approach to solving differential equations is motivated in which non-linear {DEs} are not attached directly but properties like infinitesimal symmetries or the existence of an equivalent variational principle are investigated. In the course of such investigations overdetermined {PDE-systems} are generated which are to be solved (where the term 'overdetermined' just stands for 'more conditions than free functions'). In section 2. algorithms for simplifying and solving overdetermined {PDE} systems are given together with examples. References for more details of the corresponding program {CRACK}, written by A. Brand and the author, are given.
In sections 3.-5. applications of the program {CRACK} are discussed. The first application is the investigation of symmetries of space-time metrics by solving Killing equations for Killing vectors and Killing tensors and their integrability conditions. A program {CLASSYM} that formulates these equations, written by G. Grebot, is briefly described.
In section 4. an example of the original application of {CRACK} is discussed which is the determination of symmetries of a {PDE} system. The problem is to find the symmetries of an unusual unified field theory of gravitational and hadronic interactions.
The application of symmetries with a program {APPLYSYM} is the content of section 5. where an {ODE}, resulting from an attempt to generalize Weyl's class of solutions of Einsteins field equations, is solved.
The final section is devoted to future work on, first, making a general {PDE-solver} more flexible and effective, and secondly, on applying it to more advanced applications. This section contains so far unpublished work. An example requiring the extension of {CRACK} to deal with non-polynomial non-linearities results from an investigation of interior solutions of Einstein's field equations for a sperically symmetric perfect fluid in shear-free motion by H. Stephani. A possible future application of {CRACK} is the determination of Killing tensors of higher rank. In the last sub-section an algorithm for formulating corresponding integrability conditions has been sketched. The maximal number of Killing tensors of rank $r$ in a $n-dimensional$ Riemannian space has been found to be $\frac{1}{r+1}\left(^{n+r-1}_{r}\right)\left(^{n+r}_{r}\right)$.},

  Abstract                 = {We derive algorithms to solve a technical problem in elementary catastrophe theory: how to reduce an unfolding of a singularity in a univariate function to normal form up to any given degree in the unfolding parameters. Two algorithms that iterate a simple explicit transformation are proposed, which should be suitable for easy implementation using a computer algebra system. They are proved by deriving sufficient vonditions for a class of such algorithms. The complexity and generalization of the algorithms is discussed briefly.},

We show that the validity of the naive Ward-Takahashi identities of the energy-momentum tensor implies the satisfaction of those of the vector currents. This removes an ambiguity concerning the minimal sets of anomalous current Ward-Takahashi identities. We find that all the anomalous Ward-Takahashi identities for the broad structure of n-pf's are again restricted to the axial-vector current of n-pf's of abnormal parity in a well-defined pattern, and the trace identity anomalies occur only in normal-parity n-pf's. We give all these anomalies. Our results show that there are no new anomalies associated with the inclusion of the energy-momentum tensor in the n-pf's.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper treats the steady flow fields generated inside and outside an initially circular, inextensible, cylindrical membrane filled with an incompressible viscous fluid when the membrane is placed in a two-dimensional shear flow of another viscous fluid. The Reynolds numbers of both the interior and exterior flows were assumed to be zero (‘creeping flow’), but no further approximations were made in the formulation. A series solution of the resulting free boundary-value problem in powers of a dimensionless shear rate parameter was constructed through fifth order. When combined with a conformal coordinate transformation this series gave accurate results for large deformations of the membrane (up to an aspect ratio of 2.5). The rather tedious algebraic manipulations required to obtain the series solution were done by computer with a symbol-manipulation program (reduce), which both formulated the boundary-value problems for each successive order and solved them. Results are presented which show how the shear rate and fluid viscosities influence the internal and external velocity and pressure fields, the membrane deformation and its ‘tank-treading’ frequency, and the membrane tension.

This work demonstrates that classical perturbation techniques combined with computer algebra offer a useful alternative to purely numerical methods for problems of this type.},

We investigate the underlying principles of backtrack algorithms that determine a canonical representative of a combinatorial object. We identify the parts of the algorithm that are dependent on the class of combinatorial objects and those parts that are independent of the class. An interface between the two parts is developed to provide a general backtrack algorithm for the isomorphism problem of combinatorial objects that incorporates the technique of branch-and-bound, and that also uses the automorphisms of the combinatorial object to prune the search tree. Our general algorithm incorporates from computational group theory an algorithm known as the base change algorithm. The base change algorithm allows one to recover as much information as possible about the automorphism group when a new branch of the search tree is processed. Thus, it can lead to greater pruning of the search tree. This work is intended to lead to a better understanding of the practical isomorphism algorithms. It is not intended as a contribution to the theoretical study of the complexity of the isomorphism problem.}},

  abstract  = {This paper deals with the problem of finding a base and strong generating set for the group generated by a given set of permutations. The concepts of base and strong generating set were introduced by Sims [5], [6] and provide the most effective tool for computing with permutation groups of high degree. One algorithm, originally proposed by Sims [7], is described in detail; its behavior on a number of groups is studied, and the influence of certain parameters on its performance is investigated. Another algorithm, developed by the author, is given, and it is shown how the two algorithms may be combined to yield an exceptionally fast and effective method.},

  abstract  = {A possible way of developing computer algebra systems is an ``education'' of the system. By ``education'' we mean here supplying the system with the capacity for handling new classes of mathematical objects. Tensors or, more generally, functions of several variables are an examples of such objects of practical interest. The main features of these objects which makes nontrivial the problem of incorporating them into a computer algebra system, are the symmetry properties exhibited by tensors (functions) we meet in practice. The simplification of expressions containg tensor monomials involves two operations: monomial identification and monomial pattern matching. The tensor identification problem when dummy summation indices are included and the tensor pattern matching problem when the pattern has free variables may both be reformulated as combinatorial problems. The first one is reducible to the double coset problem for the permutation group and the second, to a variant of the general combinatorial object isomorphism problem. The backtrack algorithms for solving the above two problems are based on some well-known ideas in computational group theory. A recursive variant of the tensor identification algorithm for a restricted class of symmetry groups and the algorithm implementation are discussed briefly.},

  abstract = {Software tools based on the algebraic manipulation system MACSYMA which facilitate the design, analysis and construction of finite difference programs for the numerical solution of systems of partial differential equations are described. Four packages of tools are presented: VECT, FDIFF, FSTAB and MACTRAN. The VECT package performs symbolic algebra and calculus with vectors and dyadics. It includes manipulations of dot and cross products; gradient, divergence, curl and Laplacian operators; directional derivatives and outer products. Vector and dyadic equation can be automatically expanded into components for arbitrary orthogonal coordinate systems. Scalar and vector potentials can be calculated from their gradient and curl vectors. The FDIFF package converts scalar, non-linear partial differential equations into linear, finite difference approximations. It includes tools for discretization of the domain of the PDE dependent variables, linearization of non-linear terms and conversion of derivative terms into finite difference expressions. A notation and algebra for building arbitrary finite difference operators is provided. The FSTAB package automatically performs local Fourier stability analyses on sets of finite difference equations by deriving amplification matrices and eigenvalues. The MACTRAN package converts the finite difference equations and other expressions into FORTRAN code. It provides a general purpose text processor which allows the derived FORTRAN code segments to be interspersed with fixed code from program skeletons to form complete FORTRAN programs.},

  abstract  = {Zero has a usable sign bit on some computers, but not on others. This accident of computer arithmetic influences the definition and use of familiar complex elementary functions like √ , arctan and arccosh whose domains are the whole complex plane with a slit or two drawn in it. The Principal Values of those functions are defined in terms of the logarithm function from which they inherit discontinuities across the slit(s). These discontinuities are crucial for applications to conformal maps with corners. The behavior of those functions on their slits can be read off immediately from defining Principal Expressions introduced in this paper for use by analysts. Also introduced herein are programs that implement the functions fairly accurately despite roundoff and other numerical exigencies. Except at logarithmic branch points, those functions can all be continuous up to and onto their boundary slits when zero has a sign that behaves as specified by IEEE standards for floating-point arithmetic; but those functions must be discontinuous on one side of each slit when zero is unsigned. Thus does the sign of zero lay down a trail from computer hardware through programming language compilers, run-time support libraries and applications programmers to, finally, mathematical analysts. Prepared for the joint IMA/SIAM Conference on "The State of the Art in Numerical Analysis" held at the University of Birmingham, England, April 14 18, 1986, for which the proceedings have been published in 1987 by the Oxford University Press, edited by M.
