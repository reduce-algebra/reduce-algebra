\subsection{The CVIT package}

In modern high energy physics the calculation of Feynman diagrams are
still very important. One of the difficulties of these calculations
are trace calculations. So the calculation of traces of Dirac's
$\gamma$-matrices were one of first task of computer algebra systems.
All available algorithms are based on the fact that gamma-matrices
constitute a basis of a Clifford algebra:
\[
  \left\{G_{m},G_{n}\right\} = 2g_{mn}.
\]

We present the implementation of an alternative algorithm based on
treating of gamma-matrices as 3-j symbols (details may be found in
\cite{Ilyin:89,Kennedy:1982}).

The program consists of 5 modules described below.

\subsection*{Module RED\_TO\_CVIT\_INTERFACE}

\begin{center}
Author: A.P.Kryukov \\
Purpose:interface REDUCE and CVIT package
\end{center}

RED\_TO\_CVIT\_INTERFACE module is intended for connection of REDUCE
with main module of CVIT package. The main idea is to preserve
standard REDUCE syntax for high energy calculations.  For realization
of this we redefine {\ SYMBOLIC PROCEDURE ISIMP1} from HEPhys module of
REDUCE system.

After loading CVIT package user may use switch CVIT which is {\tt ON} by
default.  If switch CVIT is {\tt OFF} then calculations of Diracs matrices
traces are performed using standard REDUCE facilities. If CVIT switch
is {\tt ON} then CVIT package will be active.

{\tt RED\_TO\_CVIT\_INTERFACE} module performs some primitive simplification
and control input data independently.  For example it remove $G_mG_m$,
check parity of the number of Dirac matrices in each trace \emph{etc}.
There is one principal restriction concerning G5-matrix. There are no
closed form for trace in non-integer dimension case when trace include
G5-matrix.  The next restriction is that if the space-time dimension
is integer then it must be even (2,4,6,...).  If these and other
restrictions are violated then the user get corresponding error
message. List of messages is included.

\subsection*{Module CVITMAPPING}

\begin{center}
Author: A.Ya.Rodionov \\
Purpose: graphs reduction
\end{center}

CVITMAPPING module is intended for diagrams calculation according to
Cvitanovic - Kennedy algorithm. The top function of this module
CALC\_SPUR is called from RED\_TO\_CVIT\_INTERFACE interface module.
The main idea of the algorithm consists in diagram simplification
according to rules (1.9') and (1.14) from [1].  The input data - trace
of Diracs gamma matrices (G-matrices) has a form of a list of
identifiers lists with cyclic order. Some of identifiers may be
identical.  In this case we assume summation over dummy indices. So
trace Sp(GbGr).Sp(GwGbGcGwGcGr) is represented as list ((b r) (w b c w
c r)).

The first step is to transform the input data to ``map'' structure and
then to reduce the map to a ``simple'' one. This transformation is made
by function TRANSFORM\_MAP\_ (top function). Transformation is made in
three steps. At the first step the input data are transformed to the
internal form - a map (by function PREPARE\_MAP\_). At the second step
a map is subjected to Fierz transformations (1.14) (function
MK\_SIMPLE\_MAP\_). At this step of optimization can be maid (if
switch CVITOP is on) by function MK\_FIRZ\_OP.  In this case Fierzing
starts with linked vertices with minimal distance (number of vertices)
between them.  After Fierz transformations map is further reduced by
vertex simplification routine MK\_SIMPLE\_VERTEX using (1.9').
Vertices reduced to primitive ones, that is to vertices with three or
less edges.  This is the last (third) step in transformation from
input to internal data.

The next step is optional.  If switch CVITBTR is on factorisation of
bubble (function FIND\_BUBBLES1) and triangle (function
FIND\_TRIANGLES1) submaps is made.  This factorisation is very
efficient for ``wheel'' diagrams and unnecessary for ``lattice'' diagrams.
Factorisation is made recursively by substituting composed edges for
bubbles and composed vertices for triangles.  So check (function
SORT\_ATLAS) must be done to test possibility of future marking
procedure.  If the check fails then a new attempt to reorganize atlas
(so we call complicated structure witch consists of MAP, COEFFicient
and DENOMinator) is made. This cause backtracking (but very seldom).
Backtracking can be traced by turning on switch CVITRACE. FIND\_BUBLTR
is the top function of this program's branch.

Then atlases must be prepared (top function WORLD\_FROM\_ATLAS) for
final algebraic calculations.  The resulted object called ``world''
consists of edges names list (EDGELIST), their marking variants
(VARIANTS) and WORLD1 structure. WORLD1 structure differs from WORLD
structure in one point.  It contains MAP2 structure instead of MAP
structure. MAP2 is very complicated structure and consist of VARIANTS,
marking plan and GSTRAND.  (GSTRAND constructed by PRE!-CALC!-MAP\_
from INTERFIERZ module.)  By marking we understand marking of edges
with numbers according to Cvitanovic - Kennedy algorithm.

The last step is performed by function CALC\_WORLD. At this step
algebraic calculations are done.  Two functions CALC\_MAP\_TAR and
CALC\_DENTAR from INTERFIERZ module make algebraic expressions in the
prefix form. This expressions are further simplified by function
{\tt REVAL}.  This is the REDUCE system general function for algebraic
expressions simplification. {\tt REVAL} and {\tt SIMP!*} are the only REDUCE
functions used in this module.

There are also some functions for printing several internal
structures: PRINT\_ATLAS, PRINT\_VERTEX, PRINT\_EDGE, PRINT\_COEFF,
PRINT\_DENOM.  This functions can be used for debugging.

If an error occur in module CVITMAPPING the error message ``ERROR IN
MAP CREATING ROUTINES'' is displayed.  Error has number 55.  The switch
CVITERROR allows to give full information about error: name of
function where error occurs and names and values of function's
arguments. If CVITERROR switch is on and backtracking fails message
about error in SORT\_ATLAS function is printed.  The result of
computation however will be correct because in this case factorized
structure is not used. This happens extremely seldom.

\subsection*{Modules INTERFIERZ, EVAL\_MAPS, AND MAP-TO-STRAND.}

\begin{center}
Author: A.Taranov \\
Purpose: evaluate single Map
\end{center}

Module INTERFIERZ exports to module CVITMAPPING three functions:
PRE-CALC-MAP\_, CALC-MAP\_TAR, CALC-DENTAR.

Function PRE-CALC-MAP\_ is used for preliminary processing of a map. It
returns a list of the form (STRAND NEWMAP TADEPOLES DELTAS) where
STRAND is strand structure described in MAP-TO-STRAND module.  NEWMAP
is a map structure without ``tadepoles'' and ``deltas''.  ``Tadepole'' is a
loop connected with map with only one line (edge). ``Delta'' is a single
line disconnected from a map.  TADEPOLES is a list of ``tadepole''
submaps.  DELTAS is a list (CONS E1 E2) where E1 and E2 are

Function CALC\_MAP\_TAR takes a list of the same form as returned by
PRE-CALC-MAP\_, a-list, of the form (...  edge . weight ...  )  and
returns a prefix form of algebraic expression corresponding to the map
numerator.

Function CALC-DENTAR returns a prefix form of algebraic expression
corresponding to the map denominator.

Module EVAL-MAP exports to module INTERFIERZ functions MK-NUMR and
STRAND-ALG-TOP.

Function MK-NUMR returns a prefix form for some combinatorial
coefficient (Pohgammer symbol).

Function STRAND-ALG-TOP performs an actual computation of a prefix
form of algebraic expression corresponding to the map numerator. This
computation is based on a ``strand'' structure constructed from the
``map'' structure.

Module MAP-TO-STRAND exports functions MAP-TO-STRAND, INCIDENT1 to
module INTERFIERZ and functions DELETEZ1, CONTRACT-STRAND,
COLOR-STRAND to module EVAL-MAPS.

Function INCIDENT1 is a selector in ``strand'' structure.  DELETEZ1
performs auxiliary optimization of ``strand''.  MAP-TO-STRAND transforms
``map'' to ``strand'' structure.  The latter is describe in program
module.

CONTRACT-STRAND do strand vertex simplifications of ``strand'' and
COLOR-STRAND finishes strand generation.
