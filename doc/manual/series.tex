\chapter{Series expansion}

Expanding an algebraic expression into a series can be done by standard \REDUCE operators, namely \f{df}, \f{sub}, and possibly \f{limit}.
Nevertheless, there are many cases where this straightforward method fails.
\REDUCE offers two different operators for this purpose:
\begin{description}
\item[\f{taylor}] computes a truncated power series.
\item[\f{ps}] computes extendible power series.
  \item[\f{fps}] computes formal power series.
\end{description}

\section{Taylor expansion}
This package carries out the Taylor expansion of an expression in one
or more variables and efficient manipulation of the resulting Taylor
series. Capabilities include basic operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division) and also application of certain algebraic
and transcendental functions.\footnote{This code was written by Rainer Sch√∂pf.}

This package can expand a specific class of functions into their
corresponding Laurent-Puiseux series.\footnote{This package was written by Wolfram Koepf and Winfried Neun.}
