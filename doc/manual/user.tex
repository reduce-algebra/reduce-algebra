\chapter{User Contributed Packages} \index{User packages}
\label{chap-user}
The complete {\REDUCE} system includes a number of packages contributed by
users that are provided as a service to the user community.  Questions
regarding these packages should be directed to their individual authors.

All such packages have been precompiled as part of the installation process.
However, many must be specifically loaded before they can be used. (Those
that are loaded automatically are so noted in their description.) You should
also consult the user notes for your particular implementation for further
information on whether this is necessary.  If it is, the relevant command is
\f{LOAD\_PACKAGE},\ttindex{LOAD\_PACKAGE} which takes a list of one or
more package names as argument, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
        load_package algint;
\end{verbatim}
although this syntax may vary from implementation to implementation.

Nearly all these packages come with separate documentation and test files
(except those noted here that have no additional documentation), which is
included, along with the source of the package, in the {\REDUCE} system
distribution.  These items should be studied for any additional details on
the use of a particular package.

\section{GUARDIAN: Guarded Expressions in Practice}
\indexpackage{GUARDIAN}\label{GUARDIAN}

Computer algebra systems typically drop some degenerate cases when
evaluating expressions, e.g., $x/x$ becomes $1$ dropping the case
$x=0$. We claim that it is feasible in practice to compute also the
degenerate cases yielding {\em guarded expressions}. We work over real
closed fields but our ideas about handling guarded expression can be
easily transferred to other situations. Using formulas as guards
provides a powerful tool for heuristically reducing the combinatorial
explosion of cases: equivalent, redundant, tautological, and
contradictive cases can be detected by simplification and quantifier
elimination. Our approach allows to simplify the expressions on the
basis of simplification knowledge on the logical side. The method
described in this paper is implemented in the {\sc reduce} package
{\sc guardian}.

The ODESOLVE package is a solver for ordinary differential equations.  At

single scalar equation presented as an algebraic expression or equation,
and it can solve only first-order equations of simple types, linear
equations with constant coefficients and Euler equations.  These solvable
types are exactly those for which Lie symmetry techniques give no useful
information.  For example, the evaluation of
\begin{verbatim}
        depend(y,x);
        odesolve(df(y,x)=x**2+e**x,y,x);
\end{verbatim}

\section{SCOPE: REDUCE source code optimization package}
\indexpackage{SCOPE}
\label{SCOPE}

SCOPE is a package for the production of an optimized form of a set of
expressions.  It applies an heuristic search for common (sub)expressions
to almost any set of proper REDUCE assignment statements.  The
output is obtained as a sequence of assignment statements.  GENTRAN is
used to facilitate expression output.

\section{SPDE: Finding symmetry groups of {PDE}'s}

\indexpackage{SPDE}
\label{package:SPDE}

The package SPDE provides a set of functions which may be used to
determine the symmetry group of Lie- or point-symmetries of a given system
of partial differential equations. In many cases the determining system is
solved completely automatically. In other cases the user has to provide
additional input information for the solution algorithm to terminate.

\section{SPECFN: Package for special functions}
\indexpackage{SPECFN}

This special function package is separated into two portions to make
it easier to handle.  The packages are called SPECFN and SPECFN2.  The
first one is more general in nature, whereas the second is devoted to
special special functions.  Additional documentation and examples can
be found in the files \texttt{specfn.tex}, \texttt{specfn.tst} and
\texttt{specfn2.tst} in the \texttt{packages/specfn} directory.

Author:  Chris Cannam, with contributions from Winfried Neun, Herbert
Melenk, Victor Adamchik, Francis Wright, Alan Barnes and several others.

This package provides algebraic manipulations of generalized
hypergeometric functions and Meijer's G function.  Generalized
hypergeometric functions are simplified towards special functions and
Meijer's G function is simplified towards special functions or generalized
hypergeometric functions.

\subsection{Overview}
A detailed description is available through the online tutorial \\
\texttt{\url{https://lie.ac.brocku.ca/crack/susy/}}. An essentially equivalent
description is available after loading \textsc{SsTools} and issuing the command
\texttt{sshelp()\$}. The correct functioning of all procedures is tested through
reading in and running \texttt{sstools.tst}. This test also illustrates
the commutator rules for products of the different fields and their
derivatives with respect to besonic and fermionic variables.

The topics in the tutorial and in \texttt{sshelp()\$} are:

\section{SUM: A package for series summation}
\indexpackage{SUM}
\hypertarget{operator:SUM}{}
\hypertarget{operator:PROD}{}

This package implements the Gosper algorithm for the summation of series.
It defines operators {\tt SUM} and {\tt PROD}.  The operator {\tt SUM}
returns the indefinite or definite summation of a given expression, and
{\tt PROD} returns the product of the given expression.

This package loads automatically.

groups such as the dihedral groups.

\section{TAYLOR: Manipulation of Taylor series}

\indexpackage{TAYLOR}
\index{Taylor series}
\index{Laurent series} \index{Puiseux series}

This package carries out the Taylor expansion of an expression in one or
more variables and efficient manipulation of the resulting Taylor series.
Capabilities include basic operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division) and also application of certain algebraic and
transcendental functions.

Author: Rainer Sch\"opf.

\section{TPS: A extendible power series package}
\indexpackage{TPS}
\ttindex{PS}

This package implements formal Laurent series expansions in one variable
using the domain mechanism of REDUCE.  This means that power series
objects can be added, multiplied, differentiated etc.,  like other first
class objects in the system.  A lazy evaluation scheme is used and thus
terms of the series are not evaluated until they are required for printing
or for use in calculating terms in other power series.  The series are
extendible giving the user the impression that the full infinite series is
being manipulated.  The errors that can sometimes occur using series that
are truncated at some fixed depth (for example when a term in the required
series depends on terms of an intermediate series beyond the truncation
depth) are thus avoided.

\iffalse
TRIGSIMP is a useful tool for all kinds of trigonometric and hyperbolic
simplification and factorization.  There are three procedures included in
TRIGSIMP: trigsimp, trigfactorize and triggcd.  The first is for finding
simplifications of trigonometric or hyperbolic expressions with many
options, the second for factorizing them and the third for finding the
greatest common divisor of two trigonometric or hyperbolic polynomials.

\section{XIDEAL: Gr\"obner Bases for exterior algebra}
\indexpackage{XIDEAL}
\label{package:XIDEAL}

XIDEAL constructs Gr\"obner bases for solving the left ideal membership
problem: Gr\"obner left ideal bases or GLIBs. For graded ideals, where each
form is homogeneous in degree, the distinction between left and right
ideals vanishes. Furthermore, if the generating forms are all homogeneous,
then the Gr\"obner bases for the non-graded and graded ideals are
identical. In this case, XIDEAL is able to save time by truncating the
Gr\"obner basis at some maximum degree if desired.

valid for ratios of products of powers, factorials, $\Gamma$ function
terms, binomial coefficients, and shifted factorials that are
rational-linear in their arguments.
