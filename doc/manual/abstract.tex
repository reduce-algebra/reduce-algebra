This document provides the user with a description of the algebraic
programming system {\REDUCE}.  The capabilities of this system include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item expansion and ordering of polynomials and rational functions,
\item substitutions and pattern matching in a wide variety of forms,
\item automatic and user controlled simplification of expressions,
\item calculations with symbolic matrices,
\item arbitrary precision integer and real arithmetic,
\item facilities for defining new functions and extending program syntax,
\item analytic differentiation and integration,
\item factorization of polynomials,
\item facilities for the solution of a variety of algebraic equations,
\item facilities for the output of expressions in a variety of formats,
\item facilities for generating numerical programs from symbolic input,
\item expansion of expressions into power series,
\item graphical display of functions and data,
\item Dirac matrix calculations of interest to high energy physicists.
\end{enumerate}
