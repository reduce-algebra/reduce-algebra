\section{Rlisp '88}

Rlisp '88 is a superset of the Rlisp that has been traditionally used for
the support of REDUCE.  It is fully documented in the book \cite{Marti:1993}.
Rlisp '88 adds to the traditional Rlisp the following facilities:
\begin{enumerate}
\item more general versions of the looping constructs \texttt{for},
\texttt{repeat} and \texttt{while};

\item support for a backquote construct;

\item support for active comments;

\item support for vectors of the form name[index];

\item support for simple structures;

\item support for records.
\end{enumerate}

In addition, ``\texttt{-}'' is a letter in Rlisp '88.  In other words, \texttt{A-B} is an
identifier, not the difference of the identifiers \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}.  If
the latter construct is required, it is necessary to put spaces around the
- character.  For compatibility between the two versions of Rlisp, we
recommend this convention be used in all symbolic mode programs.

\hypertarget{switch:RLISP88}{}
To use Rlisp '88, type \texttt{on rlisp88;}\ttindex{RLISP88}.  This switches to
symbolic mode with the Rlisp '88 syntax and extensions.  While in this
environment, it is impossible to switch to algebraic mode, or prefix
expressions by ``algebraic''.  However, symbolic mode programs written in
Rlisp '88 may be run in algebraic mode provided the rlisp88 package has been
loaded.  We also expect that many of the extensions defined in Rlisp '88
will migrate to the basic Rlisp over time.  To return to traditional Rlisp
or to switch to algebraic mode, say ``\texttt{off rlisp88;}''.
