  Abstract                 = {In this paper an involutive algorithm for construction of Grobner bases in Boolean rings is presented. The algorithm exploits the Pommaret monomial division as an involutive division. In distinction to other approaches and due to special properties of Pommaret division the algorithm allows to perform the Grobner basis computation directly in a Boolean ring which can be defined as the quotient ring F2[x1,...,xn],<x12+x1,...,xn2+xn>. Some related cardinality bounds for Pommaret and Grobner bases are derived. Efficiency of our first implementation of the algorithm is illustrated by a number of serial benchmarks.},

  Abstract                 = {The Gr\"{o}bner Walk is a method which converts a Gr\"{o}bner basis of an arbitrary dimensional ideal I to a Gr\"{o}bner basis of I with respect to another term order. The walk follows a path of intermediate Gr\"{o}bner bases according to the Gr\"{o}bner fan of I. One of the open problems in the walk algorithm is path finding in the Gr\"{o}bner fan. In order to avoid intersection points in the fan, paths are perturbed up to a certain degree. The Fractal Walk allows us to perturb the path locally in each step rather than globally. Thus, it removes the difficulty of finding the globally best perturbation degree. Our implementation shows that we even obtain speedups over the best perturbation degree because of the ``tunneling'' effect of the Fractal Walk. In addition, the Fractal Walk is compared to other Gr\"{o}bner basis conversion methods.},

  Abstract                 = { A recursion operator is an integro-differential operator which maps a generalized symmetry of a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) to a new symmetry. Therefore, the existence of a recursion operator guarantees that the PDE has infinitely many higher-order symmetries, which is a key feature of complete integrability. Completely integrable nonlinear PDEs have a bi-Hamiltonian structure and a Lax pair; they can also be solved with the inverse scattering transform and admit soliton solutions of any order. A straightforward method for the symbolic computation of polynomial recursion operators of nonlinear PDEs in (1+1) dimensions is presented. Based on conserved densities and generalized symmetries, a candidate recursion operator is built from a linear combination of scaling invariant terms with undetermined coefficients. The candidate recursion operator is substituted into its defining equation and the resulting linear system for the undetermined coefficients is solved. The method is algorithmic and is implemented in Mathematica. The resulting symbolic package PDERecursionOperator.m can be used to test the complete integrability of polynomial PDEs that can be written as nonlinear evolution equations. With PDERecursionOperator.m, recursion operators were obtained for several well-known nonlinear PDEs from mathematical physics and soliton theory. },

The application areas discussed are celestial mechanics, general relativity and quantum electrodynamics. The paper describes typical problems from each of these disciplines which can be solved using algebraic manipulative systems and presents sample programs for the solution of these problems using several algebra systems. For each discipline a review of published work acknowledging the use of algebra programs is presented and the most advanced applications are discussed in detail. In particular the Lie transform, Petrov classification and Kahane's simplification procedure are reviewed from the standpoint of algebra programs.

A number of simple examples are used to introduce the reader to the capabilities of an algebra program and a brief review of the technical problems of algebraic manipulation is given. Further applications of such systems to mathematics, chemistry and engineering are briefly mentioned in the text and relevant work is referenced in the bibliography but the main emphasis is placed on applications in theoretical physics. However, the simple examples indicate, and the applications in the physical sciences confirm, that algebra systems are capable of exploitation over a much wider area than is covered in the present review.},

We detail some of these simplification rules, and outline a method for their incorporation into an algebra system.}

  Abstract                 = {Gr\"{o}bnerbases are certain finite sets of multivariate polynomials. Many problems in polynomial ideal theory (algebraic geometry, non-linear computational geometry) can be solved by easy algorithms after transforming the polynomial sets involved in the specification of the problems into Gröbner basis form. In this paper we give some examples of applying the Gröbner bases method to problems in non-linear computational geometry (inverse kinematics in robot programming, collision detection for superellipsoids, implicitization of parametric representations of curves and surfaces, inversion problem for parametric representations, automated geometrical theorem proving, primary decomposition of implicitly defined geometrical objects). The paper starts with a brief summary of the Gröbner bases method.},

  Abstract                 = {A MACSYMA program is presented that greatly helps in the calculation of Lie symmetry groups of large systems of differential equations.

The program calculates the determining equations for systems of m differential equations of order k, with p independent and q dependent variables, where m, k, p and q are arbitrary positive integers.

The program automatically produces a list of determining equations for the coefficients of the vector field. This list has been parsed so that it is free of duplicate equations and trivial differential redundancies. Numerical factors and non-zero parameters occurring as factors are also removed. From the solution of these determining equations one can construct the Lie symmetry group.

An example shows the use of the program in batch mode. It also illustrates a feedback mechanism, that not only allows the treatment of a large number of complicated partial differential equations but also aids in solving the determining equations step by step.},

  Abstract                 = {An effort is made to develop a purely Hamiltonian formalism of the averaging method and to investigate the Hamiltonian formalism of averaged equations. This approach is applied to one-dimensional systems of hydrodynamic type (i.e., ideal-fluid systems, including mixtures and systems with internal degrees of freedom). Three important examples are considered: the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with a natural Hamiltonian formalism; general Korteweg-de Vries systems; and integrable systems (the multiphase case).},

Polynomial systems over {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb{\{}F{\}}{\_}2 {\$}{\$}with the values of variables in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb{\{}F{\}}{\_}2 {\$}{\$}are of interest, in particular, for modeling quantum computation and a number of cryptanalysis problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Gr{\"o}bner bases in Boolean rings can be calculated by an involutive algorithm based on the Janet or Pommaret division. The Pommaret division allows calculations immediately in the Boolean ring, whereas the Janet division implies use of a polynomial ring over field {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb{\{}F{\}}{\_}2 {\$}{\$}. In this paper, both divisions are considered, and distributive and recursive representations of Boolean polynomials are compared from the point of view of calculation effectiveness. Results of computer experiments with both representations for an algorithm based on the Pommaret division and for lexicographical monomial order are presented.},

We show how basic ideal theoretic operations can be performed using Gröbner bases and we exploit these constructions to inductively reduce the problem to zero dimensional ideals. Here we again exploit the structure of Gröbner bases to directly compute the primary decomposition using polynomial factorization. We also show how the reduction process can be applied to computing radicals and testing ideals for primality.},

  Abstract                 = {Solving systems of polynomial equations in an ultimate way means to nd the isolated primes of the associated variety and to present them in a way that is well suited for further computations. [5] proposes an algorithm, that uses several Gr obner basis computations for a dimension reduction argument, delaying factorization to the end of the algo-rithm. In this paper we i n v estigate the opposite approach, heavily using factorization (of multivariate polynomials), delaying the computation of stable ideal quo-tients. At a heuristic level this is exactly the well known Gr obner algorithm with factorization and constraint inequalities, available in all major computer algebra systems. In a preceding paper [9] we reported on some experience with a new version of this algorithm, implemented in our REDUCE package CALI [8]. Here we discuss, how this approach may berened to produce triangular systems in the sense of [12] and [13]. Such a renement guarantees, dierent to the usual Gr obner factorizer, to produce a quasi prime decomposition, i.e. the resulting components are at least pure dimensional radical ideals. As in [9] our method weakens the usual restriction to lexicographic term orders.}

We describe a way to interweave factorized Gröbner bases and the ideas in [5] that leads to a significant speed up in the computation of isolated primes for well splitting examples. Based on that observation we generalize the algorithm presented in [22] to the computation of primary decompositions for modules. It rests on an ideal separation argument. We also discuss the practically important question how to extract a minimal primary decomposition, neither addressed in [5] nor in [17]. For that purpose we outline a method to detect necessary embedded primes in the output collection of our algorithm, similar to [22, cor. 2.22]. The algorithms are partly implemented in version 2.2.1 of our REDUCE package CALI [7].},

It is theoretically known (see e.g. Alonso et el., 1991) that the algorithmic ideas for the computation of ideal (and module) intersections, quotients, deciding radical membership etc. in S may be adopted not only for computations in the local ring Sm but also for term orders of mixed type with standard bases replacing Gröbner bases. Using the generalization of Mora's tangent cone algorithm to arbitrary term orders we give a detailed description of the necessary modifications and restrictions.

In a second part we discuss a generalization of the deformation argument for standard bases and independent sets to term orders of mixed type. For local term orders these questions were investigated in Gräbe (1991).

  Abstract                 = {Let {$S:=k[x_{\nu}: \nu \in H]$} be a polynomial ring over the field {$k$}. For non-noetherian term orders there are essentially two ways to compute standard sets from a polynomial basis B of an ideal {$I \subset S$}, one based on Mora's tangent cone algorithm, and another one using Lazard's homogenization approach. The former applies (in its original version) only to inflimited term orders.

Encoupling ecart vector and term order we improve Mora's algorithm. The presented version applies to arbitrary term orders. It may increase also the power of existing implementations adding a new range of freedom.

Moreover, the presented generalization is the connecting bridge between Mora's and Lazard's approaches. The insight obtained this way leads to an essential simplification of the termination proof in [8], the core of many results on standard bases.

The algorithms are implemented in CALI [5], the author's REDUCE package for commutative algebra.},

We discuss also two algorithms to compute strongly independent sets that rest on the primary decomposition of squarefree monomial ideals.Usually the initial ideal in(I) of a polynomial ideal I is worse than I. In [9] the authors observed that nevertheless in(I) is not as bad as one should expect, showing that in(I) is connected in codimension one if I is prime.In the second part of the paper we add more evidence to that observation. We show that in(I) inherits (radically) unmixedness, connectedness in codimension one and connectedness outside a finite set of points from I and prove the same results also for initial submodules of free modules. The proofs use a deformation from I to in(I ).},

Their relations with the antibracketin field theory and applications to finding of Hamiltonian structures for evolution equationsare outlined. We show also that local variational differential operators of B.L. Voronov,I.V. Tyutin, and Sh.S.

It is based on the notions of variational Schouten bracket and {$\ell^{*}$}-covering. The latter serves the role of the cotangent bundle in the category of nonlinear evolution PDEs. We first consider two illustrative examples (the KdV equation and the Boussinesq system) and reconstruct for them the known Hamiltonian structures by our methods. For the coupled KdV-mKdV system, a new Hamiltonian structure is found and its uniqueness (in the class of polynomial {$(x,t)$}-independent structures) is proved. We also construct a nonlocal Hamiltonian structure for this system and prove its compatibility with the local one.},

  Abstract                 = {Zeilberger's algorithm which finds holonomic recurrence equations for definite sums of hypergeometric terms ${F(n, k)$} is extended to certain nonhypergeometric terms. An expression {$F(n, k)$} is called hypergeometric term if both {$F(n+1,k)/F(n, k)$} and {$F(n, k+1)/F(n, k)$} are rational functions. Typical examples are ratios of products of exponentials, factorials, {$\Gamma$} function terms, binomial coefficients, and Pochhammer symbols that are integer-linear with respect to {$n$} and {$k$} in their arguments.

We consider the more general case of such ratios that are rational-linear with respect to {$n$} and {$k$} in their arguments, and present an extended version of Zeilberger's algorithm for this case, using an extended version of Gosper's algorithm for indefinite summation.

In a similar way the Wilf-Zeilberger method of rational function certification of integer-linear hypergeometric identities is extended to rational-linear hypergeometric identities.

The given algorithms on definite summation apply to many cases in the literature to which neither the Zeilberger approach nor the Wilf-Zeilberger method is applicable. Examples of this type are given by theorems of Watson and Whipple, and a large list of identities ("Strange evaluations of hypergeometric series") that were studied by Gessel and Stanton. Finally we show how the algorithms can be used to generate new identities.},

The types of functions that can be treated by the given technique cover the generalized hypergeometric functions, and therefore most of the special functions that can be found in mathematical dictionaries.
The types of identities for which we present verification algorithms cover differential equations, power series representations, identities of the Rodrigues type, hypergeometric representations, and algorithms containing symbolic sums.
The current implementations of special functions in existing Computer Algebra systems do not meet these high standards as we shall show in examples. They should be modified, and we show results of our implementations.},

  Abstract                 = {Formal power series (FPS) of the form $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k(x-x_{0})^k$ are important in calculus and complex analysis. In some Computer Algebra Systems (CASs) it is possible to define an FPS by direct or recursive definition of its coefficients. Since some operations cannot be directly supported within the FPS domain, some systems generally convert FPS to finite truncated power series (TPS) for operations such as addition, multiplication, division, inversion and formal substitution. This results in a substantial loss of information. Since a goal of Computer Algebra is -- in contrast to numerical programming -- to work with formal objects and preserve such symbolic information, CAS should be able to use FPS when possible.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between FPS with positive radius of convergence and corresponding analytic functions. It should be possible to automate conversion between these forms. Among CASs only Macsyma provides a procedure powerseries to calculate FPS from analytic expressions in certain special cases, but this is rather limited.

Here we give an algorithmic approach for computing an FPS for a function from a very rich family of functions including all of the most prominent ones that can be found in mathematical dictionaries except those where the general coefficient depends on the Bernoulli, Euler, or Eulerian numbers. The algorithm has been implemented by the author and A.~Rennoch in the CAS Mathematica, and by D.~Gruntz in Maple.

Moreover, the same algorithm can sometimes be reversed to calculate a function that corresponds to a given FPS, in those cases when a certain type of ordinary differential equation can be solved.},

The algorithm is (for a given lexicographical Gröbner basis) faster, than the method of Möller & Mora (1983) using the computation of the Hilbert polynomial, and yields important additional information on independent sets and associated prime ideals. Its verification involves the new concept of strong independence modulo an ideal with respect to an admissible term order. The algorithm is implemented in the ALDES/SAC-2 system of Collins & Loos (1980), and has been tested successfully on the examples from Böge et al. (1986) and other examples.},

Similar formulae are deduced for the Zabolotskaya-Khokhlov (ZK) equation. The rest of the paper addresses the problem of Hamiltonian forms for the constructed equations. The algebraic approach fails here, and we have to take up the geometric point of view by treating our equations as submanifolds in 4-jet bundles. In this new language, purely local Hamiltonian forms are found for the KP and ZK equations; first of these reduces to a novel Hamiltonian structure for the Boussinesq equation.},

{$f_1(x_1)=0,f_2(x_1,x_2)=0,\ldots,f_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=0$}
. The main tools for the decomposition are from ideal theory and use symbolical manipulations. For the ideal generated by the polynomials which describe the solution set, a lexicographical Gröbner basis is required. A particular element of this basis allows the decomposition of the solution set. By a recursive application of these decomposition techniques the triangular subsystems are finally obtained. The algorithm gives even for non-finite solution sets often also usable decompositions.},

Hermann, Math. Ann. 95 (1926), 736--788). Even Macaulay's methods by using H-bases are not satisfactory, at least when considering modules. The concept of Gr\"{o}bner bases, introduced in Computer Algebra by Buchberger, allows us to find feasible algorithms for many problems of classical Ideal Theory by transforming them into some low dimensional systems of linear equations. Our aim is to demonstrate the effectivity of this new concept. Considering only polynomial rings {$P: = k[X_1,\ldots, X_n]$}, {$k$} a field, we generalize in Part I the notion of Gröbner bases to modules, present some equivalent properties characterizing these bases and show their good computational qualities. In Part II we construct starting with Gr\"{o}bner bases of ideals explicit free solutions, where all the bases of submodules under consideration are also Gr\"{o}bner bases, and present a reduction strategy for obtaining shorter resolutions, where all the bases have also favourable properties (T-bases). Part III deals with applications. We propose a method for constructing minimal resolutions starting with the resolutions of Part II and present a convenient way for computing the Hilbert function.},

  Abstract                 = {To every ideal I in the polynomial ring $A:=k[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ new invariants are attached, such as the Gröbner Fan F(I), the Gr\"{o}bner region G(I) and the set ATO(I) of the almost term-orderings of I, i.e. orderings which ``behave like'' term-orderings with respect to I. These invariants arise by considering the reduced Gr\"{o}bner bases of I with respect to all the term-orderings. Moreover F(I), G(I), ATO(I) can be got in a constructive way, as we show by producing a suitable algorithm which computes them.},

This special representation of a system markedly facilitates the subsequent integration of the corresponding differential equations. In this paper, the modern approach to the indicated problem is presented. This is the approach adopted in the Knuth-Bendix procedure for critical-pair/completion and then Buchberger's algorithm for completion of polynomial ideal bases (or, alternatively, for the construction of Groebner bases for ideals in a differential operator ring). The algorithm of reduction to the passive form for linear system of partial differential equations and its implementation in the algorithmic language REFAL, as well as the capabilities of the corresponding program, are outlined. Examples illustrating the power and efficiency of the system are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new,``elementary'' quantifier elimination method for various special cases of the general quantifier elimination problem for the first-order theory of real numbers. These include the elimination of one existential quantifier {$\exists x$} in front of quantifier-free formulas restricted by a non-trivial quadratic equation in {$x$} (the case considered also in [7]), and more generally in front of arbitrary quantifier-free formulas involving only polynomials that are quadratic in {$x$}. The method generalizes the linear quantifier elimination method by virtual substitution of test terms in [9]. It yields a quantifier elimination method for an arbitrary number of quantifiers in certain formulas involving only linear and quadratic occurrences of the quantified variables. Moreover, for existential formulas {$\Phi$} of this kind it yields sample answers to the query represented by {$\Phi$}. The method is implemented in REDUCE as part of the REDLOG package (see [4, 5]). Experiments show that the method is applicable to a range of benchmark examples, where it runs in most cases significantly faster than the QEPCAD package of Collins and Hong. An extension of the method to higher degree polynomials using Thom's lemma is sketched.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider linear problems in fields, ordered fields, discretely valued fields (with finite residue field or residue field of characteristic zero) and fields with finitely many independent orderings and discrete valuations. Most of the fields considered will be of characteristic zero. Formally, linear statements about these structures (with parameters) are given by formulas of the respective first-order language, in which all bound variables occur only linearly. We study symbolic algorithms (linear elimination procedures) that reduce linear formulas to linear formulas of a very simple form, i.e. quantifier-free linear formulas, and algorithms (linear decision procedures) that decide whether a given linear sentence holds in all structures of the given class. For all classes of fields considered, we find linear elimination procedures that run in double exponential space and time. As a consequence, we can show that for fields (with one or several discrete valuations), linear statements can be transferred from characteristic zero to prime characteristic p, provided p is double exponential in the length of the statement. (For similar bounds in the non-linear case, see Brown, 1978.) We find corresponding linear decision procedures in the Berman complexity classes
{$\cup_{c\in N}ST\,A(\ast,2^{cn},dn)$} for d = 1, 2.

In particular, all hese procedures run in exponential space. The technique employed is quantifier elimination via Skolem terms based on Ferrante & Rackoff (1975). Using ideas of Fischer & Rabin (1974), Berman (1977), Fürer (1982), we establish lower bounds for these problems showing that our upper bounds are essentially tight. For linear formulas with a bounded number of quantifiers all our algorithms run in polynomial time. For linear formulas of bounded quantifier alternation most of the algorithms run in time {$2^{O(nk)}$} for fixed {$k$}.},

  abstract  = {This book gives a treatment of exterior differential systems. It will in­ clude both the general theory and various applications. An exterior differential system is a system of equations on a manifold defined by equating to zero a number of exterior differential forms. When all the forms are linear, it is called a pfaffian system. Our object is to study its integral manifolds, i. e. , submanifolds satisfying all the equations of the system. A fundamental fact is that every equation implies the one obtained by exterior differentiation, so that the complete set of equations associated to an exterior differential system constitutes a differential ideal in the algebra of all smooth forms. Thus the theory is coordinate-free and computations typically have an algebraic character; however, even when coordinates are used in intermediate steps, the use of exterior algebra helps to efficiently guide the computations, and as a consequence the treatment adapts well to geometrical and physical problems. A system of partial differential equations, with any number of inde­ pendent and dependent variables and involving partial derivatives of any order, can be written as an exterior differential system. In this case we are interested in integral manifolds on which certain coordinates remain independent. The corresponding notion in exterior differential systems is the independence condition: certain pfaffian forms remain linearly indepen­ dent. Partial differential equations and exterior differential systems with an independence condition are essentially the same object.},
