In \REDUCE,  we can use the \f{COEFF} operator which returns a list of coefficients of a polynomial
with respect to  specified variables. 
On the other hand, the \f{COEFF2} operator gives a polynomial in which each coefficient is replaced by
special variables \verb|#1,#2|,$\cdots$. It is used with the same syntax as the \f{COEFF} operator:
\begin{syntax}
  \texttt{COEFF2(}\meta{EXPRN:polynomial},\,\meta{VAR:kernel}\texttt{)}\,:\,\textit{algebraic}
\end{syntax}
\textit{Example:}
\begin{verbatim}
off allfac;
f := (a+b)^2*x^2*y+(c+d)^2*x*y;
f2 := coeff2(f,x,y);
g := (2*c+d)*x^2+(3+a)*x*y^3;
g2 := coeff2(g,x,y);
\end{verbatim}
would result in the output
\begin{verbatim}
      2  2            2      2  2      2                    2
f := a *x *y + 2*a*b*x *y + b *x *y + c *x*y + 2*c*d*x*y + d *x*y

          2
f2 := #1*x *y + #2*x*y

          3        2      2        3
g := a*x*y  + 2*c*x  + d*x  + 3*x*y

          2         3
g2 := #3*x  + #4*x*y
\end{verbatim}
If you want to retrieve the values of  special variables \verb|#1,#2|,$\cdots$,
we can use the command \f{NM}. The syntax for this is:
\begin{syntax}
  \texttt{NM(}\meta{N:integer}\texttt{)}\,:\,\textit{algebraic}
\end{syntax}
It returns the value of the variable \verb|#n|. For example, to get the value of 
\verb|#1| in the above, one could say:
\begin{verbatim}
nm(1);
\end{verbatim}
yields the result
\begin{verbatim}
 2            2
a  + 2*a*b + b
\end{verbatim}
It is also possible to evaluate an expression including  special variables \verb|#1,#2,|$\cdots$
by \f{EVAL2} operator.
The syntax for this is:
\begin{syntax}
  \texttt{EVAL2(}\meta{EXPRN:rational}\texttt{)}\,:\,\textit{algebraic}
\end{syntax}
\textit{Example:}
\begin{verbatim}
coeff2(f2*g2,x,y);

    4         3  4       3         2  4
#5*x *y + #6*x *y  + #7*x *y + #8*x *y

nm(8);

#2*#4

eval2(ws);

   2                2      2              2
a*c  + 2*a*c*d + a*d  + 3*c  + 6*c*d + 3*d

\end{verbatim}
The user may remove all values of special variables \verb|#1,#2|,$\cdots$
by the command \f{RESET}, in the form
\begin{verbatim}
       RESET( );
\end{verbatim}
