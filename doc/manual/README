How to build the manual from source.
====================================

There are two scripts:

 mkpdf.sh   -- creates a PDF file using pdflatex
 mkhtml.sh  -- creates a HTML version using TeX4ht

Prerequisites are:
 1. a TeX installation, including pdflatex and makeindex (ie a standard TeX)
 2. TeX4ht (see http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn.html)

The file reduce.cfg contains the necessary configuration lines for TeX4ht.


LaTeX that works with TeX4ht HTML + MathJax output. FJW, March 2021

Avoid tabbing environments, which don't translate well to HTML.  For
columns consider a tabular environment.  For indentation of text
consider a list environment, such as a description environment or if
necessary a custom list.  For indentation of algorithms or program
code consider using an appropriate number of ~ characters.

To get correct alignment in tabular environments when using
\multicolumn it may help to use @{~} as the first column specifier.

New commands and environments that are used in math mode must be
defined in math mode for use by MathJax (which seems strange but
works), and they must be defined on every page that uses them.
Supporting HTML output both using and not using MathJax is
particularly tricky, but is possible; see e.g. guardian.tex, near the
top of the file, for an example.

Avoid unnecessary use of math mode, and nesting of math mode within
text mode within math mode within... .  For example, an array
environment containing a lot of text might work better as a tabular
environment.  Math-mode facilities that need information from the
non-math environment, such as \lefteqn, \intertext and gather
environments, do not work in MathJax and need to be implemented
differently.  Align environments work but split environments may not.
Commands related to page breaking, such as \\*, do not work, although
\\ is fine.

Headings below \subsubsection level should be avoided because they
disappear in HTML.

Nested tabular-type environments need to be handled specially, such as
by implementing the inner environment as a new command that is called
in the output environment; see specfn.tex, towards the end.

Excessively convoluted LaTeX is best avoided and is often unnecessary,
even if it works in normal LaTeX.

MathJax supports \ref{} and \eqref{}, which must appear verbatim as
text within the HTML.  The \eqref macro can easily be redefined to
output itself verbatim, but \ref should only be output verbatim when
it refers to an equation.  I therefore define a macro \eqnref in
manual.tex, which outputs \ref{} verbatim when generating MathJax
output and calls \ref otherwise.  Uses of \ref that relate to
equations must be changed to \eqnref for this mechanism to work.
