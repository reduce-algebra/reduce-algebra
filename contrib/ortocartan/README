The files *.lis are Lisp-codes of the programs.

The files *.tes are collections of test examples for the corresponding
programs.

The file ortcsman.tex is the user-manual (a Latex file) in which it is
described how to install the programs and how to use them. The manual contains
a number of explicit examples showing various applications of the programs.

The base-language of the programs is Codemist Standard Lisp, ie "csl" from
this Reduce archive.

On 18 May 2017 Andrzej Krasiski wrote, at a stage when the BSD License had
been explained to him:
"Yes, I would be happy if Ortocartan became available to everyone via
the Reduce web page. This would help in keeping it alive and perhaps it
would be useful to a few individuals. ... ..."

It is very pleasing that this is more code with a strong and long history
that still works! It is not integrated as part of Reduce, and anybody who
wants to use it will need to read the manual and build it using the raw
CSL Lisp system (it would almost certainly port to PSL easily).

Thanks are due to the authors for contributing this.
