% There is an ISSUE here. If a version of the souce code introduced an
% inline definition for a function (say FFF) then that definition gets lifted

% changed then the new definition will eventually end up in inline-defs.dat.
% However if the inline definition is removed from the source files a version
% can persist in inline-defs.dat with no mechanical scheme to get rid of it.
% At present my stance is that anybody who changes what functions are tagged
% inline has a responsibility to do a "make clean" and in due course I will
% cause that to remove the cached definitions...
