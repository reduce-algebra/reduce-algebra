% This procedure definition taken from "pslrend.red" is required for
% the factor module:
symbolic procedure carcheck fff;
   nil;  % CSL function used much as setting !*fastcar in PSL.

Comment The following functions, which are referenced in the basic
REDUCE source (RLISP, ALG1, ALG2, MATR and PHYS) should be defined to
complete the definition of REDUCE:

	BYE
	EVLOAD -- defined in "clprolo.red"
	ERROR1 -- defined in "sl-on-cl.lisp"
	MKFIL
	ORDERP -- defined in "sl-on-cl.lisp"
	QUIT
	SEPRP
	SETPCHAR.

Prototypical descriptions of these functions are as follows;

remprop('bye,'stat);

fluid '(bye!-actions!*);

% A package may put a call to some termination code on top of this list.

bye!-actions!* := '((close!-output!-files) (quit));

symbolic procedure bye;
   eval('progn . bye!-actions!*);

deflist('((bye endstat)),'stat);

Comment to make "bye" and "quit" equivalent, as stated by the REDUCE
manual;

put('quit,'newnam,'bye);

symbolic procedure mkfil u;
   % Converts file descriptor U into valid system filename.
   % FJW: I define string!-downcase in "sl-on-cl.lisp".
   if stringp u then u
   else if not idp u then typerr(u,"file name")
   else string!-downcase u;

seprp!* := {'! , '!	, '!, '!, !$eol!$}; % FJW

symbolic procedure seprp u;
   % Returns true if U is a blank or other separator (eg, tab or ff).
   % This definition replaces one in the BOOT file (and another in "build.red").
   u memq seprp!*;

procedure setpchar c;
   % Set prompt, return old one.
   begin scalar oldprompt;
      oldprompt := promptstring!*;
      promptstring!* := if stringp c then c
	  else if idp c then id2string c
	  % FJW: I don't really want to import the CL format function just
	  % to use it here.  Is this line actually used?
	  else error(0, "Unexpected prompt in setpchar");
	  % else format(nil, "~a", c);
    return oldprompt
   end;

% This procedure has already been defined in rlisp/superv, but must be
% redefined for Common Lisp to call force-output so that the prompt
% appears when it should.  This is the approach taken in the SBCL
% default top-level REPL.
symbolic procedure printprompt u;
   %Prints the prompt expression for input;
   << ofl!* and wrs nil; prin2 u; force!-output(); ofl!* and wrs cdr ofl!* >>;


Comment The following functions are only referenced if various flags are
set, or the functions are actually defined. They are defined in another
module, which is not needed to build the basic system. The name of the
flag follows the function name, enclosed in parentheses:

	CEDIT (?)
	COMPD (COMP)
	EDIT1   This function provides a link to an editor. However, a
		definition is not necessary, since REDUCE checks to see
		if it has a function value.
	EZGCDF (EZGCD)
	PRETTYPRINT (DEFN --- also called by DFPRINT)
		This function is used in particular for output of RLISP
		expressions in LISP syntax. If that feature is needed,
		and the prettyprint module is not available, then it
		should be defined as PRINT
	RPRINT (PRET)
	TIME (TIME) returns elapsed time from some arbitrary initial
		    point in milliseconds;


% Operating system interface:

flag('(system pwd cd getenv),'opfn);

flag('(system),'noval);


Comment There are a number of system constants required for each
implementation. In systems that don't support inums, the equivalent
single precision integers should be used;

% LARGEST!-SMALL!-MODULUS is the largest power of two that can
% fit in the fast arithmetic (inum) range of the implementation.
% This is constant for the life of the system and could be
% compiled in-line if the compiler permits it.

largest!-small!-modulus := 2**23;

% If the (small) modular arithmetic is always limited to LARGEST-SMALL-
% MODULUS, it all fits in the inum range of the machine, with the
% exception of modular-times, that needs to use generic arithmetic for
% the multiplication.  However, on some machines (e.g., the VAX), it is
% possible to 'borrow' the extra precision needed, so that the following
% definition works.  This will not work of course for non-inums.


Comment We need to define a function BEGIN, which acts as the top-level
call to REDUCE, and sets the appropriate variables;

remflag('(begin),'go);

symbolic procedure begin;
   begin
        !*echo := not !*int;
        !*extraecho := t;
        ifl!* := ipl!* := ofl!* := nil;
        if null date!* then go to a;
        if !*loadversion then errorset('(load entry),nil,nil);
		linelength 80;
		prin2 version!*;
		prin2 ", ";
        prin2 date!*;
        prin2t " ...";
        !*mode := if getd 'addsq then 'algebraic else 'symbolic;
        if !*mode eq 'algebraic then !*break := nil;
           %since most REDUCE users won't use LISP
        date!* := nil;
  a:    if errorp errorset('(begin1),nil,nil) then go to a;
        prin2t "Entering LISP ... "
   end;

flag('(begin),'go);


Comment Initial setups for REDUCE;

spare!* := 0;		   % We need this for bootstrapping. (FJW: Maybe!)

symchar!* := t;				   % Changed prompt when in symbolic mode.

symbolic procedure initreduce;
   % Initial declarations for REDUCE
   <<
	  statcounter := 0;

% Procedure find!!minnorm causes float overflow. Not sure why, but
% circumvent it for now by using a Common Lisp
% Implementation-Dependent Numeric Constant:

% symbolic procedure find!!minnorm();

% 	  !!minnegnorm := -!!minnorm;

% Some CSL compatibility, taken from support/psl{,rend}.red:

symbolic inline procedure prin x;  prin1 x;

remflag('(printc), 'lose);

% printc is defined in int/int.red to be prin2t, but this inline
% definition is better and is available without loading int:
symbolic inline procedure printc x; << prin2 x; terpri(); x >>;

flag('(printc), 'lose);

symbolic procedure ttab n;  while posn() < n do prin2 " ";

symbolic inline procedure explodec x; explode2 x;


% Make ON DEFN load the prettyprinter if necessary and
% OFF DEFN reinstate property lists saved during ON DEFN:

%                       (nil (!esl!-reinstate!-plists))));

% Fixes for the crack suite
% =========================

% "crack/crinit.red" defines procedure random_init for PSL or CSL
% specifically with no generic definition, so here is a CL version.
% Procedure `random_new_seed' is defined in "rlisp/random.red" to take
% a single argument, offset, which must be a positive integer.
% Function `datestamp' is defined in "sl-on-cl" to return the number
% of seconds that have elapsed since some epoch.

symbolic procedure random_init(); random_new_seed datestamp();

% "crack/crutil.red" defines this procedure only for PSL.
% Using the CL version directly doesn't work in all cases, so I
% redefine it here as in crack!

   % Rename fromname to toname and return t on success.
   % (it is defined in csl)
   system bldmsg("mv %w %w", fromname, toname) = 0;

% From "pslrend.red"; does this also apply to Common Lisp? Not
% required to run "crack.tst"!

% In the crack code it is essential that subst arranges to share some of
% its output with its input. The same may be the case for sublist too?
% The standard implementation of subst in PSL does not do this.

% Fixes for the lalr package
% ==========================

% This procedure is defined in "lalr/genparser.red".  Because Common
% Lisp seems to view equality of uninterned and interned symbols
% differently from PSL/CSL, I need explicitly to apply intern to
% identifiers but not to strings handled within this procedure until I
% can think of a way to modify sl-on-cl that works.
