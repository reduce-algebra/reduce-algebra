// Support for 128-bit floats using the SoftFloat-3a package - this
// provides some additional low level primitives that I want (eg tests for
// infinities and NaNs), and then implements conversion to and from
// character strings. To get the conversions accurate there is skeletal
// support for 256-bit "float128-float128" arithmetic.
