//
// This code is a very simple test and demonstration of the "FXTerminal.cpp"
// (or the "wxterminal.cpp" replacement) Window-mode input local editing and
// history package that I have, and in particular it illustrates how that
// code can be used. Note that if the executable here is launched as just
//     fwindemo
// it should create a window and run in it, but
//     fwindemo -w
// should run in console-mode.
//
// Well actually things are just slightly more complicated than that!
//
// When compiling on Windows my Makefile will create TWO executables
// for this program. One will be called fwindemo.com and will be linked
// with "susbsystem:console", the other will be fwindemo.exe and is set
// up as "susbsystem:windows". If you just say "fwindemo" to a normal
// DOS shell and the directory with these in is on your path then
// fwindemo.com gets launched. If you want to double-click you should do so
// on fwindemo.exe. But if you say just "fwindemo" to a cygwin shell that
// looks for fwindemo.exe, so if you need the version that remains attached
// to your console there you have to say "fwindemo.com" explictly.
// You can launch fwindemo[.com] from the command line and it will still
// launch and run in a window (unless you give it the "-w" flag). Those who
// feel the need to understand why I do all this can do web searches about
// creating programs that can run in either Windows or Console mode...
//
// On the Macintosh there is an "application bundle" (directory) called
// fwindemo.app created. the main fwindemo executable is (hard) linked to
// a suitable location within that. It is expected that Mac users will
// launch fwindemo.app by clicking on it and will run the plan fwindemo
// executable when running from a console. However in many cases unless
// the plain executable is given the "-w" flag it will internally go
// "open fwindemo.app" to launch the gui alternative. Even if typically
// Mac users might not wish to take advantage of this faciliti I personally
// find it a convenience - and it makes the overall behaviour of the system
// more compatible across platforms.

//
// To the extent that (a) it is convenient and (b) that I have completed
// development of this code, the behaviour of the Windowed interface in
// FXTerminal.cpp/wxterminal.cpp and of the console mode one in termed.c are
// compatible. The key-bindings are intended to be "emacs-like" so they
// support command to move backwards and forwards by characters and words,
// to delete characters or words, to adjust case and to scan up and down
// through a history. More elaborate variants on this idea would permit
// the user to re-assign key-bindings. I have not implemented that at all.
// Partly to try to keep my code simple and partly because I feel customised
// key-bindings are a source of terrible confusion. The other capability that
// some may miss and that perhaps I could consider adding is "completion".
//
// Because of my intended use for this code I have allocated some keys to
// menu shortcuts that will not be relevant to other people but that are
// useful to me. Not all keys can and not all keys do work under both
// FXTerminal/wxterminal and termed environments. I annotate this key-list
// with a ($) for things not active under FXTerminal/wxterminal and with (!)
// for not active or incomplete under termed.
//
//
//
//                         KEYBOARD HANDLING
//
//
// Key-bindings that I hope to make work in both terminal and windowed mode,
// on both Unix/Linux, Microsoft Windows and the Macintosh.
//
// Note that ALT can be achieved either by holding the ALT key at the
// same time as the listed key, or by pressing ESC before the key.
//
// ALT takes priority over SHIFT, and Control takes priority over ALT so
// that a character is only treated as having one attribute. If it has none
// it just inserts itself.
//
// Where I put a "-" in this table it means that I do not define the meaning
// of the keystroke. In the short term at least that will either cause the
// keystroke to be ignored, inserted, or treated the same way as the
// corresponding character without Control or ALT. In the longer term I may
// assign behaviours to some of those keys. I also want to reserve the
// possibility of making keys with both Control and ALT have yet different
// effects.
