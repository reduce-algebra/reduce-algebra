// I need to explain the operations that happen on FASL files as regards
// preservation of source code. This describes a post-2016 implementation
// which has been simplified and rationalised compared with earlier versions.
//
// The starting point for the complication is that the compiler
// arranges that if the variable !*savedef is set when it compiles
// something then the original source is saved under a '!*savedef
// tag on the property list of the name of the function concerned. For
// simple in-store compilation this happens immediately. For compilation
// into a FASL file the definition is written into the file, but whether
// it is instated onto the property list depends on the circumstances
// associated with loading the module.
// An additional mess is that in a full system there may be several
// conflicting definitions associated with the same name, and the !*savedef
// promperty can cope with just one. But having used that for some time I
// can not compfortably change it. So now there will be a second property
// !*savedefs (note plural) which is an association list of the form
//  ((checksum . definition) ...). So if there are multiple definitions that
// are identical they lead to just one entry, but of there are several that
// differ they are all kept (subject to clashes in the md60 checksums).
// Note that if the definition being instated has been constructed by some
// processing scheme that introduced gensyms then the checksums may be
// unreliable. So at least for a while I will put in some code that scans
// the data being checksummed and issues a message if a gensym or other
// uninterned symbol is seen.
// A special feature of the CSL checksumming and fasl-write/read code is that
// checksums of structures containing gensyms are liable to be preserved,
// as will the gensym status of relevant symbols. I might view that as
// clever and non-obvious, but it is important here for cases where function
// definitions have been macroexpanded.
//
// When load!-module is used to load the code this extra !*savedef information
// is ignored.
//
// There is however a scheme that can load !*savedef and !*savedefs
// properties without processing and of the other parts of the FASL file.
// This is the function load!-source.
// Neither random executable things nor compiled code get loaded by this. A
// particular thing to note is that if the compiled module was such that
// normal loading of it with load!-module led to subsidiary modules being
// loaded then this will not happen with load!-source. Thus to load all
// the modules making up a package involves finding out some other way what
// they are. I am expecting it will be rather more common to want to load
// all the source for everything that is available, and that can be
// achieved using
//   for each lib in input!-libraries do
//      for each mod in library!-members lib do load!-source mod;
// (or just use library!-members() without an argument to scan the first or
// only available library). But using load!-source without an argument
// achieves essentially just this. Well actually there are extra complications
// which mean that MOST people should use load!-source without an argument!
// In general it will be possible to have a number of read-only image files
// present together with at most one read-write one. The (Lisp) variable
// input!-libraries contains a list of rather abstract objects giving
// each library in the order that they will be searched when looking for
// a module to load. The variable output!-library is either nil (if no
// writable library is present) or is one of the libraries in the
// input!-libraries list. When load!-module (or load!-source or of course
// load!-selected!-source) loads a module it always does so from the first
// library that contains a module with the given name. Thus an image file
// that is earlier in the search order can make one that comes later. There
// is (at present????) no provision for loading modules from later in the
// search order.
// library!-members lists the modules present in a specified library. So
// if this is done for several libraries some module names may end up listed
// several times, but every time the module name is used only the first
// instance of that module will be accessed. For load!-source it will not
// matter if a module is scanned several times since the same !*savedef
// information will be instated and because I can be careful and only add
// mention of any given module once to the source record.
//
// The simple case "load!-source mod" loads all !*savedef information in the
// given module. Clearly if it is called repeatedly and several modules are
// scanned the !*savedef information present at the end will be the last
// version loaded. In addition to setting up !*savedef properties the
// load!-source function also records, for each function, which module
// it was found in. This ends up as as load!-source property for the name
// of the function, and will be a list of the names of modules in which
// a definition was found. This scheme is intended to be useful for cross-
// referencing style code that tracks down where in the source some function
// is defined. It is also there so that it is possible to identify cases
// where the same name is used for functions present in several modules. This
// shows up when (at the end of a sequence of uses of load!-source) some names
// have load!-source properties with multiple entries.
// The return value of load!-source is a list of the functions whose source
// has just been loaded.
//
// A second function "load!-selected!-source mod" is available for selective
// loading of !*savedef information.
// In this case !*savedef information is read from the module, but only
// saved for the user if a checksum computed on it matches an integer value
// present as a load!-selected!-source property of its name of if the
// load!-selected!-source property is something else non-nil (typically t).
// The checksum is calculated using md5 but then truncated to 60 bits so
// there is some (small) possibility of an unwanted definition ending up
// loaded. The load!-source propery-list entry will be set up for all
// functions, not just for the ones where checksums match and so not only
// can this be used to detect any cases of hash collisions, but it provides
// a way to collect just this source module information.
//
// load!-source and load!-selected!-source scan all available modules if
// they are called without an argument, and this will often be the most
// convenient way to use them.
//
// Note that the above is a change from previous behaviour which inspected
// variables !*savedef and load!-source at load-time to decide what to do.
// I hope it is cleaner and simpler, and by virtue of this block of comments
// it is certainly better documented!
//
// Uses with the build of Reduce:
//   The bootstrap build of Reduce has !*savedef set while it compiles the
//   code. This puts saved definitions in the FASL files and they will be
//   present at build time, but they do not get loaded by load!_module.
//
//   The "make profile" option in the Makefile measures which functions are
//   most heavily used. The measurements it records include an ordered
//   list of functions and then a checksum of the associated !*savedef
//   information using the same scheme that load!-selected will. This is
//   done so that if two modules each define a function called (say) foo
//   and profile information about each of these gets generated it will be
//   possible to distinguish between them.
//
//   The procedure that compiled from Reduce (ie Lisp) into C++ picks up
//   checksum information from the profile records and uses
//   load!-selected!-source to recover just the matching Lisp source.
//   It converts that into C++ and inserts the checksum into tables as part
//   of that C++ code. When the (final) version of Reduce is compiling
//   itself and it finds a defininition of some function (again suppose
//   it is called foo), it checks if it has a compiled-in C++ function
//   with the same name and the same checksum, and if so it ignores the
//   new definition. This leaves the C++ version to be used. If a newer
//   version of the Reduce sources provide an updated or changed definition
//   then with very high probability the new checksum will not match the
//   one associated with the C++ code, and this will lead to the newer
//   definition being compiled into bytecodes for use. So source changes
//   in Reduce may over time degrade the number of functions where faster
//   C++ versions of functions are used.
//
//   Code used via scripts/clash.sh uses load!-selected!-source
//   with no checksum on property lists. This just loads the information
//   about which modules functions are defined in. It is then possible
//   to identify and report cases where there are multiple versions of
//   functions with the same name present somewher in Reduce.
//   Given that Reduce can not check for this at build time an analysis
//   tool like this can help detect potential problem clashes or opportunities
//   to bring functions to a common place where they are available to all
//   packages that might benefit from them.
//
//   Planned future code for global type-checking of Reduce will use
//   load!-source to gain access to all the source code in a spirit of
//   what other programming systems call "reflection" but that Lisp has
//   pretty much been able to take for granted since the 1960s. In a similar
//   style future cross-referencing code might plausibly work based on
//   !*savedef information rather than by scanning source files. In general
//   tools for code analysis and improvement may find use for all of this.
//
//   If a debugging tool wanted to recover the source version of just a single
//   function it could set the load!-selected!-source property of the function
//   name to T and call load!-selected!-source - thus recovering the !*savedef
//   information for just that name without needing a checksum in advance.
//
// So here is a go at a summary:
//   load!-module     Loads code and loads any savedef entries present.
//   load!-source     Loads all savedefs and sets function location info.
//   load!-selected!-source
//                    As load!-source but ONLY loads the savedef of a
//                    function if the load!-selected!-source property of
//                    the name of the function is either true or it
//                    is an integer matching a checksum of the saved
//                    definition. Even this load!-selected!-source only
//                    recovers selected !*savedef information it loads
//                    function location information for everything.

// work-around in their code at some time I should leave this code and comment

// Note (June 1992) I now have a computer with a newer CPU chip in it and

// to keep modules a multiple of 4 bytes long.
// Note (October 1995) Well, now I have a Pentium rather than a 386, and

// old and dodgy 80386. So sometime within the next year or so I will
// remove this comment, but still leave modules padded to multiples of
// 4 bytes since maybe I would introduce more bugs removing that than I would
// save.
// (January 1999) This little essay continues to entertain me. The 386 system
// happens to be around Cambridge again as a "relic" having been discarded as
// too old-fashioned and slow by pretty well everybody! Gosh how machines
// change during the life-time of a piece of software!
// (March 2001) "early 386" bug hah. Gosh that was slow by today's standards.
