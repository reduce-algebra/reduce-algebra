//
// Before trying to do anything at all you must call cslstart. This will
// allocate memory, load an initial heap image etc etc. The argc and argv
// passed here are as per normal C startup. The key issue here is how
// Reduce will find the file "reduce.img" that it needs to load. There are
// two plausible ways you can achieve this.
// (a) argv[0] should contain a (for choice) fully rooted path as in
//     /usr/local/bin/reduce
// or  c:\my-reduce\binaries\reduce.exe
//     In that case the name of the supposed execitable has ".img" tagged
//     onto it, so the image is expected to be at say /usr/local/bin/reduce.img
//     If the application name is the name of a symbolic link then the
//     image file is looked for in the dircetory that the link points to.
// (b) You can put "-i" "/path/to/reduce.img" in two consecutive entries
//     in argv to give an explicit indication of where the image file
//     is to be found. This should override any attempt to look via
//     argv[0].
// Most users should not need to provide any further options, but options
// are decoded just as for the ordinary version of the system.
//
// Any textual output generated during system-started is sent, character
// by character, via the callback function. Eg pass an option "-v" in
// argv and see a big banner.
//

extern void cslstart(int argc, const char *argv[],
                     character_writer *wr);

//
// At the end of a run please call cslfinish to close down everything
// in a reasonably orderly manner and release memory. I should cautiously
// note that the system will have some memory leaks so cslfinish will
// not return EVERYTHING that has been allocated - if this worries you
// please search for and correct the defects. Again the callback function
// is used to process any output generated during close-down.
//

extern int cslfinish(character_writer *wr);

//
// As a general-purpose escape it is possible to get a Lisp function
// (with no arguments) called. This function does that re-binding
// what would otherwise be terminal input and output to the two
// callback functions. By writing your own custom Lisp function and then
// calling it this way you get almost ultimate flexibility, if not
// convenience! For used of the Reduce algebra system I hope that the
// suite of more specialised functions listed later on will prove
// easier to use.
//

extern int execute_lisp_function(const char *fname,
                                 character_reader *r,

//
// The next collection of functions provide for interaction with the
// Reduce algebra system using a model based on a Reverse Polish
// Calculator. You use RPN-style calls to build a fragment of parse
// tree and can them as Reduce to "simplify" it. Having simplified it
// you can ask for a simple prefix-form of the result to be generated and
// returned, and there are functions for traversing that.
//

//
// Example:
//  Task:   differentiate (x+1)^2 with respect to x
//  Method: clear_stack();
//          push_symbol("x");
//          push_small_integer(1);
//          make_function_call("plus",2);   function plus has 2 arguments.
//          push_small_integer(2);
//          make_function_call("expt",2);
//          push_symbol("x");
//          make_function_call("df",2);     "df" is for differentiate.
//                                          To use this you need to learn
//                                          the named Reduce uses for all
//                                          relevant operations.
//          simplify();                     up until now the form built
//                                          has been just the prefix form
//                                          (expt (plus x 1) 2).
//          dup();                          because save will pop the stack
//          save(1);                        save in "memory number 1".
//          make_printable();               the simplified form is in
//                                          a Reduce internal representation,
//                                          so this restores it to simple
//                                          prefix form.
//          p = get_value();
// now p holds a handle on the result, and it can be traversed
// using functions atom(), first(), rest() and functions that extract the
// name of a symbol or the value of an integer. You should assume that the
// handle becomes invalid as soon as you call one of the other functions.
// this is because they can all trigger garbage collection and that can
// relocate data.
// The functions used to build expressions all return zero on success or
// an error-code otherwise. In the initial release the error-codes are
// not documented other than via reading the source files. Furthermore the
// consequence of a calculation seeking input or generating output is not
// well sorted.
//


//
// After having called cslstart() you can set the I/O callback functions
// using this. If you set one or both to nullptr this indicates use of
// stdin/stdout as per usual rather than an callback, otherwise whenever
// anybody wants to read or write they use these procedures. It is then
// your responsibility to cope with whatever text gets exchanged!
