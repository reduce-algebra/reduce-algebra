The following functions on at least some Linux systems insist that the
same versin of glibc is available at run time as when linking EVEN WHEN
STATIC LINKING IS USED. This seems to make a pretty fundamental mockery
of the idea of static linking.

getgrid        fox: FXFile
getpwnam       fox: FXFile    This is used from FXFileDialog and hence
getpwuid       fox: FXFile    because I want to be able to open files!
getpwnam_r     fox: FXFile
getpwuid_r     fox: FXFile

The above are used
   To find the home directory associated with a user (by name)
   To find the home directory associated with a iser (by uid)
   To find the owner of a file or the group associared with a file.

gethostbyname  print.c
getservbyname  ?? comes as package deal with gethostbyname ??
