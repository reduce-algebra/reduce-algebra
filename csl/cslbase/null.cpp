// There are some places where the autoconf/automake system wants to create
// a Makefile that will include a certain file on a conditional basis. At
// present in some such cases I find it messy to avoid including any file at
// all so I sometimes compile and link in this little file - not because it
// does anything but because in other cases something more useful might be
// included instead!
