Integer Multiplication in CSL


In general big-integers are stored with 31-bit digits (so that the 32nd bit
in the word can be used as a guard bit or to make C code to separate off
carries easier). The most significant word is treated as signed, while all
lower digits are unsigned.

For multiplication of values that use up to 12 words simple classical
"paper and pencil" long multiplication is performed.

Beyond that Karatsuba multiplication is used. This is based on the
formula

  (a1,a0)*(b1,b0) =>
  a1*b1
     (a1+a0)*(b1+b0)-a1*b1-a0*b0
         a0*b0
and used just 3 half-width multiplications. This leads to a growth rate
of around n^1.585 (rather than the n^2 for classical multiplication). The
switch at 12 words is made based on empirical measurements that suggest that
that is around the point where Karatsuba's better assymptotic behaviour
outweighs its extra overhead.

If the computer used supports threads and is detected as having at least 4
processor cores then at around 120 words a further variation is introduced:
the three half-width multiplications noted above run in three separate
threads. One is the main thread, the other two are ones established at the
start of a Lisp run and are dedicated to this purpose. Semaphores are used
to allow these worker threads to start their job and again when the main
thread needs to verify that the workers have finished before it proceeds.
Only one level of parallel decomposition is used.

The measurements I have for this are as follows (on a Windows 7 machine).
The calculation is merely squaring a number with the given number of
decimal digits, so the forst line related to squaring 10^100. This is below
the threshold for any Karatsuba scheme to apply which is why the times
with and without parallelism enabled are the same. The times quoted are
in milliseconds and are for repeating the multiplication a number of
times judged to make all the sequential cases take roughly the same
amount of time.
Observe that with the code in the form as measured that when the inputs are
up to 800 decimal digits long the overheads associated with the concurrent
method make it not worth while, but from say 1200 digits onwards it gives
useful benefit. But about 2500 digits it gives a speed doubling. The best
speed up observed is a factor of 2.6, where a factor of 3 is the absolute
limit.

The code that implements this is in csl/cslbase/arith02.c, and anybody
who wants to tinker with it to see if they can speed it up in general, or
reduce the overheads so that the break-even points for the "fast" methods
get smaller is very welcome to have a go, and I will be interested to
know what is achieved.
