// The tutorial at http://shaharmike.com/cpp/libclang/ with title
// "Using libclang to Parse C++ (aka libclang 101)".
// and his sample code and explanation really helped me get started.
// Thank you. If you are concerned about licenses please check that
// web-site, which is not explicit on that front but I believe clearly
// does not intend to restrict use of the material. And anyway all that
// actually remains of Mike's original code is very standard use of the
// clang API. And this files as a whole is rather trivial. So as far as
// I (A C Norman) am concerned it is sample code that anybody can use
// without worrying about my contributions. But obviously the BSD-style
// disclaimers of liability hold.

// (b) If the return-type for the function is itself a function you could
//     have parentheses in its description, which would be misinterpreted
//     by the naive code here.
// (c) I might be that there are other C++ situations and idioms that I have
//     not for now though of! Things like decorations at the end of the
//     protytype, default values for arguments, ...
// So a proper scheme would use more of libclang to discover the source
// extent of the function prototype PROPERLY, and perhaps the resulting code
// would be neater than the mess I have here at present. If some helpful
// person with more libclang experience than I have could sort that out and
