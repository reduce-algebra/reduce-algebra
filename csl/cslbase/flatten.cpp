// arithlib.hpp is to be a header-only library and because of that
// I want it to be a single file that can be #included. However
// for development purposes I want to keep some sections of code that
// it must incorporate in separate files. This will sometimes be just
// a matter of wanting to structure the code while I work on it and
// sometimes because the other code fragments could be useful of themselves
// not just within arithlib. So I have a file called arithlib.base.hpp that
// uses "#include" directives to incorporate those sub-libraries. This
// tool merges things to make the single-file version. Its use is:
//    flatten arithlib.base.hpp  arithlib.hpp
// The reads arithlib.base.hpp and if it finds a line of the form
//    #include "filename"
// and the named file is present in the current directory then the
// contents of the file are inserted in place of the #include directive.
// This process applies recursively.
