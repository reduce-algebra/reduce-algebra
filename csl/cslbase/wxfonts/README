Each font-set used here has an associated README file that gives
information about where it came from and the license terms that
permit use.

The fonts provided here, and plausible uses for them are:

Computer Modern Unicode Typewriter
    This is a fixed-pitch Unicode font suitable for a terminal window.
The shapes are as for the Computer Modern typewriter face, but this has
a good range of accented, Greek, Cyrilic  and special characters.

AR PL New Sung (Fireflysung)
    A serif font that provides respectable coverage of the CJK pages of
Unicode. My thoughts are that I would just use it to extend coverage to
those parts of the Unicode range.

cslSTIXxxx
    A range of serif fonts, with Bold, Italic and BoldItalic variants.
The initial parts of the font are along the lines of Times or Computer
Modern Roman, but the coverage extents well into the rest of Unicode.
Character shapes as from many TeX mathematical fonts (eg maths italic,
blackboard, gothic, script) are provided in the block from U+1d400. Note that
that is not in the basic multilingual plane. A wide range of mathematical
symbols are present in cslSTIXMath-Regular. These fonts were originally
just STIX-Regular etc (from the STID-Word set) but those versions rely on
advanced rendering APIs to access glyphs that have apparent codepoints
above U+10ffff, ie that are outside the valid Unicode range. To ease
portability to multiple platforms I have made versions that also make those
special glyphs available from U+108000 onwards (ie in a Provate Use Area) so
that legacy rendering can display them.
