// The idea of this file is that it uses #include to gather ALL the source
// files for CSL so they get compiled as a single program unit. This will
// perhaps be a long compilation that needs much memory, but it could give
// extra opportunities for function inlining and other inter-procedural
// optimisations, as well as bein in some respects a "simpler" build process.
