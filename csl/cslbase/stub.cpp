// The object of this code is to have several binaries embedded in it and
// it picks one, copies it to disc on a temporary file and from there
// it can execute it. It decides which to use based on whether it finds
// that the system being run on is 64-bit capable and whether it ought to
// use a cygwin version to interact with a cygwin console using unix-style
// calls to set raw mode and ncurses to move around the screen. It also
// takes a view as to when it should use a cygwin version so that although
// it is running on windows it can use an X11 display: it may do that
// if it finds the environment variable DISPLAY set or it discovers that it
// is being run on a windows host that is being accessed over ssh. When these
// special cases do not apply it will run a native windows version,
//
// An accompanying program "addresource.c" is used to add extra bodies
// of code to a compiled version of this.

// contact to a Windows console since in that case the run is (probably)
// non-interactive and so terminal handling is not an issue.
// Furthermore the command-line option "--", (which is used here to redirect
// the standard output) is detected and is similarly viewed as a signature
// of non-interactive use.

//     and I am very liable to have a Windows display available. So there is
//     no point in using cygwin even if it is available.
// (b) If the user has put "-- file" on the command line then that redirects
//     the output to a file. In that case again there is no point in trying
//     to use cygwin console management and I feel happier defaulting to
//     use of the native windows version.
// (c) If either stdin or stdout is attached to a "disk" file then as in case
//     (b) I am not interactive enough to need cygwin console handling. Note

//     be attached to pipes rather than to a disk file.

// However if a command line flag "--cygwin" is provided I will make that
// force use of Cygwin. That use-case is required for people to use the

// the code will only even attempt to run a GUI if DISPLAY is set, and in
