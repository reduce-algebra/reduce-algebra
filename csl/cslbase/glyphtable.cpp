// Usage:
//    g++ glyphtable.cpp -o glyphtable
//    ./glyphtable wxfonts/*.glyphs
//    [admire the file coverage.cpp]
//
// This is achieved my going "make coverage.cpp" here...
//

//
// To sort out coverage maps for the fonts that I may use I use a
// sequence of steps.
// First I use glyphIgo (https://code.google.com/p/glyphigo/) to scan
// the .ttf or .oft file for the font so as to list the codes of all the
// glyphs defined. This relies on having the python-fontforge module
// installed. That gives me plain text lists of codepoints. This program
// then packs them to provide bitmaps.
// I pack a range of fonts, but information about each ends up in the
// table that is generated tagged with its name.
// Several special issues arise:
// (1) directly coded old-style TeX fonts do not need coverage maps because
//     they use just the codes in the range 0-127 (well at least logically...)
//     so going to this trouble for cmr10, cmmi10 etc is not necessary.
// (2) I choose to ignore any codes that are not in the Basic Multilingual
//     Plane. It appears that latinmodern-math defined a bunch of glyphs
//     with codes have large codes. Eg "mathematical" letters (including
//     math italic) starts at U+1d400 (to U+1d7ff) and will be needed. But
//     I will take special action on them!
// (3) Codes in the range U+d800 to U+f8ff are either surrogates or private
//     and so at one stage I planned to omit them from the maps to save
//     a little space. I now view that is a micro-optimisation that means that
//     when symbols I really want exist in the private range I am in trouble,
//     so I have backed off and just map the whole range.
// (4) By comparing the glyph-lists I observe (with some relief) that all
//     the different variations on Latin Modern Roman provide the same
//     set of glyphs so I only need a single map to describe multiple fonts.
// (5) The Latin Modern Fonts are covered by an instance of the LaTeX
//     Project Public License. That insists that any derived works provide
//     information on just how the derivation was conducted and how to
//     obtain the original files packed in the original manner. Their
//     terms are clearly envisaging alteration of the actual fonts, but
//     they insist that even re-packing fonts, using only a subset or
//     extracting information from the fonts leads to a derived work. So
//     the file that will be created by this is subject to limitations, and
//     I generate a comment in it that is intended to fulfill my obligations.
//     Note that this all means that anybody redistributing the font
//     coverage file other than in the context of the whole of CSL or Reduce
//     needs to check the license to bve certain that their usage is
//     permitted. I am perhaps sad about this extra complication, but believe
//     that in context it is acceptable.
// (6) The font "CMU Typewriter Text" is subject to an X11 license, and the
//     directory that contains the font includes a copy of the formal
//     statement of that and copyright attribution to Andrey V. Panov.
// (7) The Deja Vu font is subject to a permissive license also included
//     alongside the font itself. The key limitation is that modifications
//     of the font may not be made without altering the font name.
//     I am taking a view that for the fully permissive licenses that mere
//     coverage bitmaps do not need very much by way of embedded comment
//     and that they will only make sense when distributed alongside the
//     relevant fonts (which should always be accompanied by their
//     associated licenses).
//
// I want this table because I have not (yet?) found a way in wxWidgets where
// I can test if a codepoint is properly supported in the selected fond, but
// then when I render text I sometimes get a character from some quite
// different font appearing. With these tables I can take control of
// character/font substitution for myself.
