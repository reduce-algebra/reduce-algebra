The above is the form of Copyright notice I have in many of these files.
The two funny characters are \169 and \184, which are the Copyright symbol
in two of the code pages used with Windows. The first seems to be used
with Courier and the System fonts, while the second appears in the
Terminal fonts.  Systems that only use the lower seven bits of the
codes will see the above as "(C)/)/8".
