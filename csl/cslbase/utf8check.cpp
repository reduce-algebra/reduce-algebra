//
// This is a pretty silly program! It looks at Unicode characters and tests
// when case-folding can change the number of utf-8 bytes needed to encode
// them. At least in the default locales I have set up on my own Mac and
// Linux systems there is never a change of encoded length, but on Windows
// there sometimes is. For instance towlower when applied to a capital letter
// "I" with a dot over it gives back a simple lower case "i". A consequence
// of this is of course that folding case backwards and forwards can be
// lossy. The code here lists the cases I came across on my Windows
// system when running under cygwin. A windows version compiled using
// i686-w64-mingw32-gcc seems to behave like Linux with no discrepancies
// shown.
//
// There is a real prospect that the concept of "case" and folding will be
// locale sensitive and so running this in different locales may be
// instructive.
