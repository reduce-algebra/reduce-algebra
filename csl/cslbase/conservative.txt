                     Conservative Garbage Collection
                     ===============================


This note is to help me while I design and implement one, and comments on
changes from a previous world. This is a fresh version of these notes and
is being started in April 2016. I had done some redesign in October 2017, but
the latest changes are from June 2018 - no now May/June 2019.
And now I update this for April 2021, having coded far enough to understand
yet more. Work on this has interleaves with other projects and also there
have been a couple of significant student exercises that explored the areas
of concern here and helped me come to the current design. But it is being
a long haul.



Memory is arranged in an hierarchy. At the largest scale there are segments
which may be gigabytes in size. These are the blocks grabbed from the
operating system and I will support there being up to 16. That allows
the system to start with a modest allocation and then if necessary expand:
it does not have to reserve the full amount right from the start.

Each segment is structures as a sequence of 8 Mbyte pages, each of which is
aligned at an 8 Mbyte boundary. A major reason for having these pages is that
I expect to trigger a minor (ie ephemeral/generational) GC when a page
becomes full. Pages are all on one of five chains:
   freePages
   mostlyFreePages
   partlyFreePages
   busyPages
   borrowedPages
and each will always have a field called chunkCount set in a header. A
page with chunkCount=0 does not have any data stored within it. Two pages
are noted specially for the benefit of minor GCs - currentPage and
previousPage. Allocation will go on within currentPage and there are
pointers gFringe and gLimit associated with it. During a time when minor
GCs may arise there is a stablePage with sFringe and sLimit pointing into
it: a minor GC copies material out from preciousPage into stablePage.

The borrowedPages chain will be thread-local so in reality there can be
as many such chains as their are threads.

When a segment is created all the pages in it are chained onto freePages
with a chunkCount of zero.

Within each page there can be chunks, which are 16Kbytes by default but
can be larger if a large object gets created. The chunks within a page
are recorded in a chunkMap[] array at the start of the page. There is
also a flag chunksSorted that indicates whether the entries from 0 to
chunkCount are arranged in ascending order. While a page is active and
allocation is happening within it the region gFringe to gLimit may be
used to allocate more chunks, and pinnedChunks 

in what follows the term "pinned" indicates data where some ambiguous value
(from the C++ stack) seems to refer to it. One can not be certain whether
that value is a genuine Lisp pointer or merely an integer or part of a
floating point value that happens to look a bit like a pointer. The item
that it may possibly refer to will be pinned so that the GC does not copy
and move it to a different location. This can lead to the accidental
preservation of data that is not actually needed and it tends to introduce
some memory fragmentation, but in other respects it simplifies system
structure.

There are two sorts of chunks: normal and pinned, identified by a field in
the chunk header. The header also contains a length field. At the start of
a GC a normal chunk has Lisp data contiguous from the start of its data
region as far as a chunkFringe (which can be the end of the chunk, but by
being less than that can indicate some wasted space at the end of the chunk
not containing valid or useful data). That data must be properly formatted
so that the GC can parse it so as to make a linear scan of the chunk.
A pinned chunk contains a non-null reference to a linked list that lives
somewhere in the heap where the items in the heap are the doubleword
aligned addresses of the start of each separate pinned item. The pinned items
will of course be valid, but all other space within the chunk can contain
any arbitrary junk - in reality it will contain the remains of structures
that has been copied away from it by a previous GC. The non-empty list of
pinned addresses identifies the chunk as pinned, but also all pinned chunks
are chained on a page starting with a pinnedChunks field, and all pages
that contain any pinned chunks are chained through a pagePinChain field with
the list there in pagesPinChain.

There are two reasons for having chunks. One is that they provide the
granularity at which memory as a whole in pinned, especially since it is
expected that there can be clusters of pinned objects that were allocated
all all about the same time. The second is that to support multiple threads
each thread can have its own chunk and then allocation within that chunk
does not involved synchronization and so is cheap. Allocating the next chunk
within a page will often be just an atomic increment of a page fringe pointer
and potentially expensive synchronization only happens when the page becomes
full.

Each page contains several bitmaps. One is pinnedMap[] with one bit for
each 8-byte aligned address in the page. The other is dirtyMap where a bit
gets set in it by the "write barrier" that records when a RPLAC style
operation updates data that may be in an old page. Ideally that would
only be set when an "up pointer" got created - ie a reference from stable
data to something in the current or previous page. It will be necessary to
find the location of every dirty cell, and doing so using a full linear
scan of dirtyMap could be onerous, so two smaller bitmaps refine the
information to identify large blocks that are clear of any tainting.
Pages that have any dirty bits at all are kept in a 2-way chain. That
is a 2-way list to make it easy to remove a page from the list. Well the
intent is to keep it as a 1-way chain most of the time but perhaps at the
start of GC to traverse that once and put in the back-pointers.

So now I will try a sketch of (major) garbage collection. It is important
to imagine that this is not the first GC, so there may be pinned chunks
let over from previous times.

I am not going to discuss synchronizing multiple threads ahead of GC here,
but I am going to suppose that before the GC proper is entered that every
chunk has been sanitised so that up as far as its chunkFringe the data
is neat and can be scanned linearly. There is a further fairly lengthy
writeup on all the synchronization that I will have elsewhere, but the
main plan at present is that when ANY thread fills up a page ALL threads
must be halted so that garbage collection will not be disrupted by them
altering things under its feet.

(1) For each page in busyPages set chunkMapSorted to false and hasPinned
to false. Clear the pinMap[]. Clear the global chain of pages that
contain pinned stuff. Set oldPages from usedPages and set usedPages
empty.
(2) For each ambiguous value (from the C++ stack or stacks) I need to
record what must be pinned. Given a value v a binary search through
the segment table can use about 4 steps to identify which segment it is
within (if any). Then masking with (-8M) will provide a reference to the
page that is involved. If the stableChunkCount field there is zero then the
page is empty and v is not a useful pointer.
If chunkCount is non-zero the page is in use and various other fields in
it will be valid.
If chunkMapSorted is false then sort from 0 to chunkCount and set it
true. So only pages with a possible ambiguous reference get their map
sorted and for each of then that happens just once. A binary search in
chunkMap from 0 to chunkCount then identified a chunk that v may
relate to. If chunks are 16K and pages 8M there can be up to 512 chunks per
page so this may be 9 comparisons. Now the wasPinned entry in that chunk
can be checked and it indicates whether the chunk was a pinned or ordinary
one. If ordinary than at this stage set a bit in the pinMap for the
doubleword that v references provided that is within the data region of
the chunk up to chunkFringe. Tag the chunk as containing (new) pinned
material and put chain it via chunkPinChain on its page. It it was a chunk
that had been pinned by a previous GC traverse its pinnedObjects list and for
each object there test if v lies within the object. If so then set
a bit in pinMap and here that can be at the head of the object to be
pinned. Note that this completes investigation of ambiguous pointers
without altering any chunkMap entries or chunkCount values, but it
would be undesirable for this process to try to pin any region in the
space the the GC is going to copy stuff into, hence
(3) Allocate a page and chunk so that the GC becomes able to allocate
new space - mostly it will be copying old data into that. 
(4) It is now necessary to tidy up pinning information. There will now be
a list of all pages where items were pinned, and for each such page a
list of the chunks. Some of those will be newly pinned chunks and some
continued pinning of currently pinned material. So it is straightforward
to scan all the chunks that are involved. If they were previously pinned
than the stuff pinned now is a subset of the material on their pinnedObjects
list. Create a new version of that list in fresh space and store a reference
to that in the pinnedObjects field. For previously ordinary chunks it is
necessary to perform a parse-and-scan of the chunk content to find the
head address of each newly pinned item by checking for a mark bit that
corresponds to anywhere within the object and migrating it to mark the
header. Again create a list to go in pinnedObjects.
The pinnedObjects list is a little delicate. If some ambiguous value pointed
into it and it was a standard list then that could lead to all of it ending
up preserved, and that would be undesirable. So it gets created as a "list"
but where all pointers in it as tagged as fixnums (ie as immediate data).
That way if a cell in it is pointed at by something wild only that call
gets saved.
By the end of this phase the page pinMaps contain marks against the first
word of each pinned item. 
(5) I can now start evacuation. This is the process of migrating data from
the existing space to the new one, leaving forwarding pointers behind.
Start by traversing the list of all pages that have pinned chunks, then
the chunks concerned and finally the pinnedObjects chains there and parse
memory to identify the type and size of the pinned objects and evacuate
all pointer fields within them. Note that by now if a pointer refers to
something that is pinned that it is a precise pointer so anding with (-8M)
will always give a page that it is within, and the bitmap in the page then
reports in whether it is pinned without too much overhead.
(6) Evacuate all precise list bases. All the work done so far in the GC will
have been done using a single thread. Potentially from now on several may
be brought into play.
(7) Evacuation has moved data from the old space into fresh chunks. Each of
these must now be scanned and data fields within it evacuated. If the
evacuation process is thread safe then several chunks can be scanned at
once. When all chunks have been processed this stage completes. That is
harder to arrange than one might at first imagine because at the end it
will be necessary to be scannning a chunk that is also being used as the
destination for copied material.
(8) For every page in oldPages see if the page has pinned chunks and
if so reset its chunkMap[] and chunkCount to include just them and arrange
that the pinned chunks are chained so that future allocation can work
around them. If the page does not have pinned chunks just set chunkCount
to zero. In either case set chunkMapSorted false and re-chain onto either
freePages or mostlyFreePages.
(9) Ensure that fringe and limit (etc) values are nicely set up for the
allocation process post GC.



Now I will try to explain a minor GC which wull be provoked each time a
page becomes full. Of course if at that stage it appears that memory os
becoming overall full a major GC will happen instead. In support of the
minor GC every RPLAC (and assignment into an array, and setting of fields
in symbol heads) will have activated a write barrier that leaves a bit set
in a dirtyMap[] when a value is written that is a pointer to within the
current or previous page. The requirement there is that the location
so updated must be updated if the data that was pointed at moves, and
the data pointer at must be preserved even if nothing in the current
or previous page references it directly.
Let me discuss for a moment the interaction with pinning. Suppose that
I allocate as current a page that contains pinned data. Then in addition to
it having had (at some stage in the past) a reference from the C++ stack
it may have one or more references from locations in the stable part of the
heap. When the page becomes current those references are now from stable
data into the current page... so two questions arise: do they count as
up-pointers and when (if ever) can the data be un-pinned. So there are
several cases to mention:
(a) pinned chunks in the mostlyFree chain;
(b) pinned checks when something moved from mostlyFree to current;
(c) a pinned chunk as in (b) when current becomes previous;
(d) newly pinned material in previous observed by the scan of ambiguous
roots at the start of a minor GC.
I suspect that the best policy will that once a chunk is pinned only
a major GC can lift that status. Well the whole concept of a minor GC is
almost like treating all the heap apart from current and previous as being
pinned and any waste space in the stable part of the heap is not recovered.
So this path is not totally ridiculous. A pinned chunk will have a chain
that enumerates the precise pinned items in it, and that will always be
in the stable part of the heap and so is safe. So perhaps everything works
out easily. When a previous page has been evacuated it may end up either
fully empty or containing some pinned blocks. Totally free pages get
selected as the preference for new current pages, while ones with pinned
regions embedded will be the first choice for material evacuated from
previous to form part of the stable region of the heap.
Now just to consider the case I want to see what would be involved if I
wanted a minor GC to be able to un-pin some data from previous. To make
that possible every location that points to a pinned item must be marked
as dirty so that the GC can check if any precise pointers remain to things
that at some stage became pinned. Since the stable parts of the heap are
not fully scanned during a minor GC this has to happen partly during the
previous precise GC and also when any item is evacuated from previous into
the stable heap. If it refers to pinned data it must be marked dirty. The
write barrier must also notice any update that makes (perhaps old) structure
point at anything in a pinned region of a page on the freePages list.
My expectation is that arranging all of that would complicate the write
barrier and the GC and lead to a larger number of cells marked as dirty,
and that the consequence would be overhead that more than balanced any
hoped for reduction in pinning.

The overview here is that I intend to copy material out from JUST the
previous page and then rename current as previous - setting up a new
empty page as the new current. The reasoning is that any material present
in previous was allocated "a page ago" (ie current has been filled from
empty since then) so it has a certain age, and data in it that was going
to be discarded perhaps has. Also that the C++ stack is most likely to
contain references to stuff currently being worked on, and that will be
concentrated in current. So the hope (and again it is just a hope) is that
there may not be too much data in previous to be pinned.
However I will worry out loud here that it could be that there will usually
be several new pinned items in the previous page. This could arise if data
was allocated then 16 Mbyte worth or further allocation (ie enough to fill up
a the current page and then when that has become previous to fill up the new
current page and) and then a GC happens with references to that data still
on the stack. If that sort of thing happens often then a serious proportion
of vacated pages will have some pinned matter in them - in particular too
many for them to all get gobbled up into the stable heap. In such a situation
when a page with some pinned chunks works through current and previous it
can collect more, and over a number of cycles it could get seriously
clogged. So I want to schedule the most heavily pinned pages for allocation
into the stable heap and the cleanest for recycling as a new current.
Precise sorting my load is probably too costly, so I will maintain just
3 lists of pages - freePages, mostlyFreePages and partlyFreePages.

(1) Set the pinnedMap for previous clear. Arrange to be able to allocate for
copying purposes in a section that will count as "old" or "stable".
(2) Scan ambiguous roots and only pay attention to ones that refer within
previous - set a pin bit on those locations.
(3) Scan contents of pinned items in previous and process their fields.
If those refer to non-pinned data in previous copy it to stable.
(4) Scan current, leaving the objects there where they are but when those
objects have fields that refer to something not pinned but in recent then
move that item to the stable part of the heap.
(5) Scan precise roots doing much the same.
(6) Scan every location that was marked dirty by the write barrier. If
it refers to current leave it dirty. If if refers to previous then copy that
data to stable (unless it was pinned) and clear the dirty bit. If the
testing now shows it as not referring to either of those (it may be that
the test here can be more precise that the one in the write barrier) clear
the bit.
(7) make current into previous and allocate a fresh current page, for
choice from freePages and never from partlyFreePages. If there is no space
in either freePages or mostlyFreePages the trigger a major GC even if
overall the memory is not half full.

If minor GCs are to be supported then at the end of a major GC every page
that is created to hold copied data must have its dirty-map cleared and
the dirty bits associated with pinned data left in the mostlyFree or
partlyFree must also be cleared. Also each time the minor GC moves stuff
out of the previous page but finds that it is moving down a copy of a
reference to the current page (which is sort of treated as pinned there) it
must set a dirty bit to record the up-pointer, and each time it allocates a
new stable page then un-pinned parts of that must me marked clean and
any pinned chunks in it scanned and if there are up-pointers (ie to current)
they must be marked dirty.

More thought than I have at present given to it needs to go into the issue
of whether some fields within symbols should be automatically viewed as
dirty. A particular case is value cells, but property-list head pointers
might plausibly be considered too. It would be easy to arrange that on
creation of a symbol and when its head was moved by the garbage collector
that its value cell was automatically tagged as dirty. The up-side of that
is that there would then be no need to trigger a write barrier on updating
the value either by setting it or with fluid binding. The down-side would be
that the ephemeral GC would need to check the contents of every symbol's
value cell and check if it contained a pointer into the recent page. Well
all the files making up Reduce seem to involve a little under 25K symbols,
and if a major GC works by evacuating the current package early all those
will end up reasonably close together in memory, so scanning all of them
(and indeed such other fields in symbol-heads as might be of interest) will
be cheap enough. So that is my current plan. So that introduces more work in
the evacuate procedure - it must mark fields in a copied symbol head as
dirty!
