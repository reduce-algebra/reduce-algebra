// The code here provides an implementation of hash tables that use
// integer keys (uintptr_t) and can optionally associate similar width
// integer values. Because the integers are uintptr_t it can also naturally
// support the use of memory addresses as keys - that is hash tables based
// on the Lisp "eq" test. And the values could be treated as pointers.
// At present it does not provide any way of using keys of other
// types (eg strings). The particular value 0 is not valid for use as
// a key, and is used internally to indicate an empty location in the
// table.

// The strategy used is a variation of cuckoo hashing using two
// hash functions and where each position in the table is arranged as
// a bucket of size 2. The result is that lookup can involve evaluating
// the two hash functions and then checking four locations in the table.
// This gives bounded cost lookup for both successful and unsuccessful
// searches, and pairs of table accesses are ad adjacent memory addresses
// and so will be cache friendly. The table will (almost always) not
// overflow until it is somewhat over 80% full. When it does its size
// is doubled and so throught its use (except when it is empty because
// it has just been created or because many hash_delete operations have
// been performed) it will fluctuate between around 40% and 80% full.
// Insert operations will almost always be cheap, and it is expected that
// in the amortised sense the cost of insertion is constant. Empirically
// this cost is such that insertion costs around 5 times as much as
// lookup. Because of the way that the table size is doubled as it
// grows this is roughly twice the cost you would onserve if you had
// known how much data would be used early and allocated a big enough
// table to start with. For inserting around 1.7 million keys into a
// table set to have initial size 2 million (with no table doubling
// steps required) the total cost of insertion was around 2.7 times the
// total cost of lookup.
