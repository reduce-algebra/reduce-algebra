% Big-number arithmetic done digit by digit for use testing the
% native arithmetic package.

% Please note that that this is GROTTY code not intended for general re-use.
% It is JUST to provide a regression test on CSL arithmetic. It calls upon a
% number of CSL specials (eg validate!-number, which checks if the internal
% format of a number is proper - specifically if checks that there are no
% bignums with unwanted leading zero digits and no bignums where the value
% could have been represented as a fixnum).


% The code tests a lot of arithmetic cases that I expect to be close to
% critical values (eg near powers of two) and also a load of random
% values - these random values should be different each time the test is
% run.
