Commentary and further explanation
==================================

The CSL-based binary versions of Reduce are linked with code that is subject
to the LGPL 2.1. A copy of that license is present in the reduce.doc directory
(which is where this file is). As of March 2009 the LGPL library involved
is the FOX GUI toolkit - in future it is possible that some code will
use the Qt library. The use of these (and any other LGPL code) is covered by
the LGPL.

LGPL states, in part:

   "6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
       link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce
       a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that
       work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
       modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
       engineering for debugging such modifications."

The Reduce binaries are works containing part of the library as in the above,
and I choose to make them available under the BSD license as at the top of
this file. Note that one objective of the LGPL is that applications linked
against an LGPL library can even be released subject to commercial closed
licenses, and those could permit or prohibit further distribution at their
whim. The BSD license should in general be seen as more open than any
proprietary distribution, so its use should not cause worry to any (L)GPL
enthusiast.

When the complete binary archive (a .tar.bz2 or .zip file) is fetched it
will automatically include a copy of this Reduce documentation and hence
it will satisfy license terms as regard propogation of the conditions of
use.

To ensure that my initial distribution of the binary is valid under terms
of LGPL 2.1 I note

 (a) the BSD license that I apply downstream permits modification and
     reverse engineering, so the LGPL requirement that these be allowed
     is satisfied.
 (b) This notice is intended to be "prominent notice" of the use of LGPL
     libraries and that my actions are sanctioned by the LGPL 2.1.
 (c) My intent is that the executable program will not display copyright
     notices. If other developers change that state then they have a
     responsibility to arrange to add in matching copyright notices related
     to the LGPL code.
 (d) in accordance with Sourceforge policy as well as the LGPL full source
     of all components (well beyond the "minimal source" that LGPL
     identifies) will be released on sourceforge alongside any binary
     distribution, thus LGPL (6)(d) is used to cover source distribution.
 (e) again since this is an open source project under the BSD license
     all relevant data, utility programs, build scripts and the like
     to make it possible to recompile everything on a standard system
     is naturally present.


Observe that the consequences of all the above is that the license terms that
apply to anybody who downloads a binary distribution from Sourceforge are
the permissive BSD ones rather than any more restrictive (L)GPL ones.

Also note that anybody who fetches source and rebuilds or relinks against
any LGPL libraries themselves will need to ensure that they adhere to the
license terms if they distribute the resulting binary, and they will probably
also wish to place a source archive beside their own binaries.
