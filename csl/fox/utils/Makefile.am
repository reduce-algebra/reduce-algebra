# by and for "make" can be cygwin-style ones. In particular they may
# include cygwin links and "/cygdrive/x" drive specifications. For these
# to be processed properly it is vital that reswrap be compiled using the
# native cygwin tool-chain, and that in particular it must not use
# x86_64-w64-mingw-gcc etc in ways that could create a native
# windows-mode binary. So I will have defined the conditional "cygwinshell"
# when I am building for mingw-style Windows.
