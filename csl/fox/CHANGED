The file in this directory are a derived work of FOX 1.6.21, and are
subject to the LGPL, a copy of which is present here. One requirement
of that is that changes are prominently noted and a date is attached. This
file is to collect that information in a way intended to be as clear and
easy for people to use as possible. I am taking the view that files that one
would re-generate using the gnu autoconf tools (eg Makefile.in) do not need
to be marked or listed provided the master copy (eg Makefile.am) that they
are derived from is. I will also use this as a place to provide a very very
brief annotation as to why some of these files had to be altered.


(a) Changed files

autogen.sh                     remake "configure" script etc
configure.in                   support for mingw, windows64, fat-MAC etc
include/FXApp.h                "unsigned"->"FX_WPARAM" to survive windows-64
include/FXText.h               add TEXT_COLUMNWRAP manifest
include/fxdefs.h               windows-64 support
src/FXApp.cpp                  as FXApp.h
src/FXDCWindow.cpp             Windows-64 and type of stipple.
src/FXDebugTarget.cpp          64-bit item in a printf on windows-64
src/FXFont.cpp                 old versions of fontconfig do not have FX_WIDTH
                               and some FC_WEIGHT options. Fix so it compiles
                               on my Tiger Mac.
src/FXFontSelector.cpp         set up size in selector dialog to match
                               requested size if you have a scalable font.
src/FXText.cpp                 option to wrap at a fixed column
src/FXWindow.cpp               HANDLE vs FXuint to be win64-safe
src/Makefile.am                support 64-bit windows build using
                               command-line tools, add in my new files,
                               remove use of libtool.
utils/Makefile.am              if cross-building use gcc to compile utils.


(b) New files

include/FXDCNativePrinter.h    header files for my new stuff
include/FXMathText.h
include/FXPostscriptFont.h
include/FXShowMath.h
include/FXTerminal.h

src/FXDCNativePrinter.cpp      can use windows native printing as well as
                               printing to postscript
src/FXMathText.cpp             like FXText.cpp but scope for in-line maths
src/FXPostscriptFont.cpp       Postscript font metrics for printing
src/FXPrintSample.cpp          accompanied the basis that FXDCNativePrinter
                               built on
src/FXShowMath.cpp             display mathematical expressions
src/FXTerminal.cpp             a terminal for interactive sessions to run in
src/FXWorker.cpp               thread-related parts assocated with FXTermninal
