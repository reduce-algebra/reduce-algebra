The file in this directory are a derived work of FOX 1.6.49, and are
subject to the LGPL, a copy of which is present here. One requirement
of that is that changes are prominently noted and a date is attached. This
file is to collect that information in a way intended to be as clear and
easy for people to use as possible. I am taking the view that files that one
would re-generate using the gnu autoconf tools (eg Makefile.in) do not need
to be marked or listed provided the master copy (eg Makefile.am) that they
are derived from is. I will also use this as a place to provide a very very
brief annotation as to why some of these files had to be altered.

============================================================


Changes to the ACN parts of the code:

January 2014:
  FXShowMath.cpp: alter treatment of TeX "~" to use character code 0xb6
     to stand for it. It measures as if it was "x" but is not printed at
     all, so it acts like a blank character. This improves the behaviour
     Reduce has on
         write "this is a message with blanks in";
     Well actually I make the width 2/3 that of an "x" which looks nicer.
     Also a fix so that
         write "#";
     works properly. It used to generate a messy failure message.
     Use a downwards displaced n-rule to show "\_" so that names
     with embedded underscores are handled a bit better. Then re-correct
     so that matrices can again be displayed OK.

February 2014: Move towards some Unicode interface to terminal handling so
     that non-ASCII characters may eventually be handled better.

     (Feb 9) The code builds with FXMathText.cpp brought much more up to
     date, and characters with codes beyond the range 32-127 are now
     semi coped-with by the GUI even if application code that uses it may
     not cope. However as part of the changes to deal with this COPY
     operations in FXTerminal.cpp have been disabled until they can be
     revistited and recast so as to be able to use UTF-8. Also it seems that
     input such as "A B <pound> C" leads to a screen display with a small
     amount of junk visible to the right of the "C", so there is somewhere
     that allowance for multi-octet sequences has not been got quite right.
     I might HOPE to fix both of these soon. I believe that the second
     only arises if you type in an extended characters (eg an accented
     letter on a non-UK/non-US keyboard or a pounds sign on a UK keyboard)
     and that had previously been even more broken... so I will not view
     that as too high priority.
     (Feb 11) Above changes broken and so now undone - will check them in
     again when better tested! Start migration to a copy of the stuff
     here based on fox 1.6.49

     (Feb 26) Most of migration to fox 1.6.49 complete.
     (Feb 27) Further tidying up. COPY & PASTE still need to be put back.
     (Feb 28) Support for plain text in buffer to support COPY of maths
              output.
     (Mar 13) ignore SIGTTOU message so that if code is started in the
              background attempts to use tcsetattr do not make it hang.
     (Mar 26) ignore "win" prefix and "32" suffix when extracting program
              name.
     (Apr 18) more care with 2-byte wchar_t, and make "TERM=dumb" behave.

December 2014: Change logic for finding help files.

February 2015: Add menus to pop up dialog boxes for a range of Reduce
     algebraic operations.

March 2015: increase the pool size in FXShowMath.cpp because when it overflows
     everything seems to crash. I will need a proper fix some time because
     my change of buffer size delays rather than cures the issue!

April 2015: A proper fix (I hope) for the issue noted from March 2015.

July 2015: adjustment to characters used in the display of \left| and
           \right|, plus a spelling fix.

December 2015: changes (mostly to fwin.cpp & immediate friends) to support
      packing a macintosh build into an application bundle.
