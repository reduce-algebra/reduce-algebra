The file in this directory are a derived work of FOX 1.6.49, and are
subject to the LGPL, a copy of which is present here. One requirement
of that is that changes are prominently noted and a date is attached. This
file is to collect that information in a way intended to be as clear and
easy for people to use as possible. I am taking the view that files that one
would re-generate using the gnu autoconf tools (eg Makefile.in) do not need
to be marked or listed provided the master copy (eg Makefile.am) that they
are derived from is. I will also use this as a place to provide a very very
brief annotation as to why some of these files had to be altered.

============================================================


Changes to the ACN parts of the code:

January 2014:
  FXShowMath.cpp: alter treatment of TeX "~" to use character code 0xb6
     to stand for it. It measures as if it was "x" but is not printed at
     all, so it acts like a blank character. This improves the behaviour
     Reduce has on
         write "this is a message with blanks in";
     Well actually I make the width 2/3 that of an "x" which looks nicer.
     Also a fix so that
         write "#";
     works properly. It used to generate a messy failure message.
     Use a downwards displaced n-rule to show "\_" so that names
     with embedded underscores are handled a bit better. Then re-correct
     so that matrices can again be displayed OK.

February 2014: Move towards some Unicode interface to terminal handling so
     that non-ASCII characters may eventually be handled better.

     (Feb 9) The code builds with FXMathText.cpp brought much more up to
     date, and characters with codes beyond the range 32-127 are now
     semi coped-with by the GUI even if application code that uses it may
     not cope. However as part of the changes to deal with this COPY
     operations in FXTerminal.cpp have been disabled until they can be
     revistited and recast so as to be able to use UTF-8. Also it seems that
     input such as "A B <pound> C" leads to a screen display with a small
     amount of junk visible to the right of the "C", so there is somewhere
     that allowance for multi-octet sequences has not been got quite right.
     I might HOPE to fix both of these soon. I believe that the second
     only arises if you type in an extended characters (eg an accented
     letter on a non-UK/non-US keyboard or a pounds sign on a UK keyboard)
     and that had previously been even more broken... so I will not view
     that as too high priority.
     (Feb 11) Above changes broken and so now undone - will check them in
     again when better tested! Start migration to a copy of the stuff
     here based on fox 1.6.49

     (Feb 26) Most of migration to fox 1.6.49 complete.
     (Feb 27) Further tidying up. COPY & PASTE still need to be put back.
     (Feb 28) Support for plain text in buffer to support COPY of maths
              output.
     (Mar 13) ignore SIGTTOU message so that if code is started in the
              background attempts to use tcsetattr do not make it hang.
     (Mar 26) ignore "win" prefix and "32" suffix when extracting program
              name.
     (Apr 18) more care with 2-byte wchar_t, and make "TERM=dumb" behave.

December 2014: Change logic for finding help files.

February 2015: Add menus to pop up dialog boxes for a range of Reduce
     algebraic operations.

March 2015: increase the pool size in FXShowMath.cpp because when it overflows
     everything seems to crash. I will need a proper fix some time because
     my change of buffer size delays rather than cures the issue!

April 2015: A proper fix (I hope) for the issue noted from March 2015.

July 2015: adjustment to characters used in the display of \left| and
           \right|, plus a spelling fix.

December 2015: changes (mostly to fwin.cpp & immediate friends) to support
      packing a macintosh build into an application bundle.
      Then follow-on corrections to get the Windows case working again!

January 2016: Updates to fwin.cpp to break a single huge procedure into
      several smaller chunks, and fix bugs introduced over the previous
      few weeks!

January 2016: Correction of typos in the FXReduceMenus.cpp
      (and another few of the same...)     

November 2016: Correction re updating the switches menu state.

March 2016: Small changes in the ACN/Reduce specific code to track what
      I have done in the cslbase directory

April 2017. Small tidy up operations in the ACN specific code.

August 2017. Tidy up the use of "namespace" with the files that I had
      added. A consequence of this is that FOX must be re-build for
      use with versions of CSL that adhere to the new namespace treatment.

May 2018. Put test for presence of sigaction into the autoconf stuff, so that
      my fwin.h/fwin.cpp can use if where available.

September 2018. I have tried to rationalize the issue about builds that do
      or do not support windowing and ones that do or do not support
      local editing via cursor addressing at a console - both with those
      choices made at build time and when it is not clear until run-time
      what can happen. I have made what should be enhancements to terminal
      handling code that should - for instance - make detection of ^C more
      prompt and reliable. And input history here now gets saved from
      session to session.

February 2019: Changes in FXterminal.cpp and my parts of FXText.cpp that
      put an extra level of buffering into the transfer of matereial to
      the GUI.
      This (I hope!) speeds up display of huge formulae in Reduce.

March 2019. The word "register" will be utterly rejected in C++17, and now
      we are in 2019, and so C++17 gradually become the default. Since the
      keyword was only ever to help with performance I will just delete it
      everywhere it occurs! Yuk for the C++ standard breaking existing code!

      (more in March) All sorts of adjustment to get the September 2018
      changes working after many of them got accidentally messed up in an
      editing error. Also edit configure.ac to force compilation in at least
      C++11 mode. This adds a directory "fox/m4" with a macro for detecting
      C++ versions, but subversion will tend to report a conflict fetching
      that because there will be an existing m4 directory. Resolve eg by going
      "svn -R revert ." in the fox directory followed by a further svn update,
      or possibly deleting the fox/m4 directory and then letting subversion
      restore it (and then doing a full reconfigure)...
      #include both <stdlib.h> and <cstdlib> in fx.h so that one can be
      certain of accessing library functions either with undecorated names
      like "abort" and with qualified ones like "std::abort"

      One checkin had left some stray trace print statements in... I have
      now removed them.

      Fixes to make the situation where input is not direct from a terminal
      in termed.cpp work again!

      Add some debugging hooks to fx.h, eg my_assert and friends.

      #include both <stdlib.h> and <cstdlib> so that library functions can be
      referenced either as (eg) "abort" or "std::abort", where I view the
      latter as the safer and more forward looking, if uglier!

      Ensure that lines that are to be printed are nul-terminated when
      passed to printBufferText  

      Correct accessing the "gap" when trying to get a pointer to the box structure
      for the formula.

May 2019. A lot more changes to terminal handling and ^C processing. My latest
      model is that it should be
        ^C raise an exception in the Lisp that unwinds without a backtrace
        ^G raise an exception that unwinds with a backtrace
        ALT-^C exit the system at once
        ALG-^G run a break loop
      At present CSL has the start of a framework for break loops but has
      not got that in a workable state, so ALT-^G causes an odd effect - but
      that is an issue for CSL not for my FOX adjustments here.
