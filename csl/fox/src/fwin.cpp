// This file might have been a symbolic link to cslbase/fwin.cpp but
// I fwish to use msys2 as a development environment on Windoes sometimes
// and its support for symbolic links is restricted by the the fact that
// Windows and Linux do things differently. So by default the "ln -s"
// command makes a deep copy rather than setting up a link. By this use of
// #include I get the effect of the single version of the file subject
// to concerns about path searches etc.

// This file should be considered to be covered by the same BSD license that
// most of the files in cslbase use. I have not included the full text since
// it is over-bulky for such a silly and tiny file!

// $Id:

#include "../../cslbase/fwin.cpp"

// end of fwin.cpp
