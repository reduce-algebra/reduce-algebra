% Was bug44
% Variables don't migrate properly into domain elements that are not
% numbers.

load_package tps;

ps(1/(1+x),x,0);

ws + x;

end;

% This was never intended  -- algebraic operations on two power series domain
% elements or a numerical domain elemnent and a power series objects results
% in automatic expansion into a single power series object as does
% differentiation, exponentiation etc. (but not integration).

% The remedy is simple:

load_package tps;

ps(1/(1+x),x,0);

ps(ws + x,x,0);

ps(int(ws,x),x,0);

end;
