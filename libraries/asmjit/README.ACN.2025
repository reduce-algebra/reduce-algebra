I have added CYGWIN and MINGW32 to the set of OSes that support 64-bit
file-offsets by default. This is just 2 extra lines ion core/api-build_p.h.
I have done this because Cygwin does not provide either open64() or
ftruncate64() and the x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ toolchain under Cygwin
does not provide open64 but does have ftruncate64. So my patch leaves
the mingw32 build using ftruncate where it might ideally use ftruncate64
but I find it hard to believe that this will hurt me.
