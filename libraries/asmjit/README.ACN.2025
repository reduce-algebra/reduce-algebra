I have added CYGWIN and MINGW32 to the set of OSes that support 64-bit
file-offsets by default. This is just 2 extra lines ion core/api-build_p.h.
I have done this because Cygwin does not provide either open64() or
ftruncate64() and with the release version of asmjit without my patch an
attempt is made to use them and asmjit does not build.

I rather believe that I would be happier if rather than having an explicit
catalogue of OSes there that cmake would check for the presence of eg
open64 and only try to use it if it existed. But maybe that is because I
am much more used to automake than to cmake...
