This is a copy of the libffi sources extracted from where "macports"
fetched it. It is here so that Reduce can have an embedded copy of libffi in
case that has not been installed at a system level, and the files here
have not been modified from the versions used with macports even though
I will not use all of them. The "Makefile" here is copies into a Reduce
build tree for use there and is not suitable for general purposes. It
should work on either Intel or ARM-based Macs provided a sufficiently up
to date Xcode is installed, and should then build universal versions of
the library.
