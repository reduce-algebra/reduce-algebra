    (e) rounding error on p + r, bounded by 2^-117 (absolute) and 2^-126

     We distinguish two cases here: E<>0 and E=0.

     If E<>0, then |r_in| > 2^-0.53 and |p| < 2^-1.47, thus |r| > 2^-1.59.
     The absolute errors (b), (c1), (c2), (d1), (d2) are bounded by

     Together with the relative error (a) e1=2^-126.41 on E*log(2) and

     |(1+e1)*(1+e2)*(1+e3)-1| < 2^-124.55.

     If E=0, then the rounding error (a) on E*log(2) vanishes, and likewise
     the rounding error (e) on p + r, since r=0. We further distinguish two
     cases: either i <> {127, 127}, or 127 <= i <= 128.

     If E=0 and i <> {127, 128}: the errors (a) and (e) vanish since r=0.
     Using interval arithmetic to analyze each of the possible (i,j) pairs,
     using the fact that the errors (c1) and (c2) are bounded by 1/2 ulp
     of the corresponding values, and that the errors (d1) and (d2) are
     bounded by 2 ulps of the corresponding result, we find (see routine

     maximal relative error is bounded by 2^-123.89, obtained for i=126
     and j=8256.

     If E=0 and (i=127 or i=128), then we have _INVERSE_2_1[i-90]=1 thus
     _LOG_INV_2_1[i-90]=0, and the errors (c1) and (d1) also vanish.
     It only remains errors (b), (c2) and (d2). We further distinguish
     two sub-cases: either j <> {8191, 8192}, or 8191 <= j <= 8192.

     If E=0, i in {127,128} and j <> {8191, 8192}, then using the same method
     as in case E=0 and i <> {127, 128}, we find that the relative error
     is bounded by 2^-122.88 (attained for j=8193). See routine
     max_rel_err_p2_case2() in the accompanying file dint.sage.

     It remains the case E=0, i in {127,128} and j in {8191, 8192}. In this
     case the errors (c2) and (d2) are also zero, it only remains error (b),
     which is bounded by 2^-124.82 (relative).

     In summary, the relative error is bounded:
     * if E<>0, by 2^-124.55
     * if E=0 and i <> {127, 128}, by 2^-123.89
     * if E=0, i in {127, 128}, j <> {8191, 8192}, by 2^-122.88
     * if E=0, i in {127, 128}, j in {8191, 8192}, by 2^-124.82

     In all cases, the relative error is bounded by 2^-122.88,
     where the largest bound comes from the case E=0, i in {127, 128},
     and j <> {8191, 8192}.

     (e) rounding error on p + r, bounded by 2^-245 (absolute) and
         2^-254 (relative)
     We distinguish two cases here: E<>0 and E=0.

     If E<>0, then |r_in| > 0.69314 and |p| < 0.3574153, thus |r| > 0.33572.
     The absolute errors (b), (c1), (c2), (d1), (d2) are bounded by
     2^-265.67 + 2^-258 + 2^-263 + 2^-256 + 2^-261 < 2^-255.63, which thus
     converts to 2^-255.63/0.33572 < 2^-254.05 as relative error.
     Together with the relative error e1=2^-253.67 on E*log(2) and e2=2^-254
     on p+r, this yields with e3=2^-254.05:
     |(1+e1)*(1+e2)*(1+e3)-1| < 2^-252.31.

     If E=0, then the rounding error (a) on E*log(2) vanishes, and likewise
     the rounding error (e) on p + r, since r=0. We further distinguish two
     cases: either i <> {127, 127}, or 127 <= i <= 128.

     If E=0 and i <> {127, 128}: the errors (a) and (e) vanish since r=0.
     Using interval arithmetic to analyze each of the possible (i,j) pairs,
     using the fact that the errors (c1) and (c2) are bounded by 1/2 ulp
     of the corresponding values, and that the errors (d1) and (d2) are
     bounded by 2 ulps of the corresponding result, we find (see routine
     max_rel_err_p3_case1 in the accompanying file qint.sage) that the
     maximal relative error is bounded by 2^-251.88, obtained for i=126
     and j=8256.

     If E=0 and (i=127 or i=128), then we have _INVERSE_3_1[i-90]=1 thus
     _LOG_INV_3_1[i-90]=0, and the errors (c1) and (d1) also vanish.
     It only remains errors (b), (c2) and (d2). We further distinguish
     two sub-cases: either j <> {8191, 8192}, or 8191 <= j <= 8192.

     If E=0, i in {127,128} and j <> {8191, 8192}, then using the same method
     as in case E=0 and i <> {127, 128}, we find that the relative error
     is bounded by 2^-250.74 (attained for j=8193). See routine
     max_rel_err_p3_case2() in the accompanying file dint.sage.

     It remains the case E=0, i in {127,128} and j in {8191, 8192}. In this
     case the errors (c2) and (d2) are also zero, it only remains error (b),
     which is bounded by 2^-252.66 (relative).

     In summary, the relative error is bounded:
     * if E<>0, by 2^-252.31
     * if E=0 and i <> {127, 128}, by 2^-251.88
     * if E=0, i in {127, 128}, j <> {8191, 8192}, by 2^-250.74
     * if E=0, i in {127, 128}, j in {8191, 8192}, by 2^-252.66

     In all cases, the relative error is bounded by 2^-250.74
     where the largest bound comes from the case E=0, i in {127, 128},
     and j <> {8191, 8192}.

   distance < 2^-112.55 from an exact value or a midpoint.
   All these values should fail the 2nd rounding test, and thus enter
   the exact_pow() routine.

   Note: in [4] the 2nd part of the set S is (x,y) = (m,2^F*n)
   for F integer, -5 <= F < 0, n odd integer, 3 <= n <= 34, m odd integer.
   We believe it should be read instead:
   (x,y) = (2^E*m,2^F*n) for E,F integers, -5 <= F < 0, n odd integer,
   3 <= n <= 34, m odd integer.
   The bound 35 from [2,3] was improved to 34 in [4].

   All these inputs are in the F < 0 case.

   The last entry is the denominator q of y as exact rational.
   If (x,y) is a worst case, any (2^(j*q)*x,y) is also one.
   For some x=2^E*n with n odd, if E is not divisible by q=2^-F,
   then no E+j*q will be, so the corresponding entry will be rejected
   by the "check that E is divisible by 2^-F" test.
   The only remaining one is the first one, where 2^-F divides E.
