This is a directory for externally provided libraries that may be useful
for both the PSL and CSL branches of Reduce. The dirtectory "original"
will in general hold a copy of an up-stream archive from which each
library is derived. That is liable to contain all the notices and licenses
that apply. Note that in order that the final binaries of Reduce do not
end up unduly limited the external components here should either be BSD
licensed or under some similar non-restrictive terms, or at worst under
LGPL. Incorporation of GPL (as distinct from LGPL) code would have the
effect of making the BSD freedoms of the package as a whole ineffective.
