Installation Instructions
-------------------------

To build and install WinEditLine, do the following:

1. From a MSYS/MinGW shell

cd in the WinEditLine root folder, then issue the following commands:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -G"MSYS Makefiles" ..
$ make install


2. From a Windows CMD shell

cd in the WinEditLine root folder, then issue the following commands:

C:\Users\ptosco> mkdir build
C:\Users\ptosco> cd build

then, for a 32-bit build:

C:\Users\ptosco> cmake -G"Visual Studio 10" ..
C:\Users\ptosco> c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\^
MSBuild.exe /p:Configuration=Release INSTALL.vcxproj

instead, for a 64-bit build:

C:\Users\ptosco> cmake -G"Visual Studio 10 Win64" ..
C:\Users\ptosco> c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\^
MSBuild.exe /p:Configuration=Release INSTALL.vcxproj

The path to the MSBuild.exe binary might vary depending on the
installation on your system.



Static libraries are installed in the lib32, lib64 folders, while
DLLs and test programs are installed in the bin32, bin64 folders;
all these folders are located in the WinEditLine root directory.
edit_test.exe and edit_test_dll.exe are test programs which can
be used to verify that both static and shared libedit versions have
been built and work correctly. libedit_test_dll.c is a nice, portable
example contributed by Tim Hudson which shows how to build programs
without introducing an explicit dependency from libedit: if the
libedit shared library is installed in the system, then it will be
loaded at runtime and used, otherwise the calling program will
fall back on standard fgets(). libedit_test.c is a standard example
of static linking against libedit_static.a/edit_static.lib.

Pre-built static libraries and DLLs are provided for both 32 and
64-bit Windows in the lib32, lib64, bin32, bin64 folders. Files
whose name starts with "libedit" were built with MinGW compilers,
while those starting with "edit" were built with MSVC 2010.
