# This expects a full set of log files to have been created locally, and it
# copies them all into the packages directory with a ".new" suffix. This
# is expected to be a foundation for installing a full new set of logs
# in the source tree when a major release is made.

# It is also an illustration that the packages.map file can be processed using
# shell scripts as well as Lisp code is that is useful.
