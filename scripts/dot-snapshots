# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is a prototype and demonstration ".snapshots" file. The machine
# names and addresses used here are relevant to me, but not to anybody else,
# so you will need to adapt it to your own needs before using it.
# The machine names shown are in general the ones reported by "uname -n".
#
# This looks dauntingly long, but is in fact rather simple. It is a table
# indicating that if you are at present on a machine called X and you want to
# build a snapshot for a platform Y how you should go about it. Its structure
# is then
#
# case `uname -n`
# X1)
#   hosts_Y1() {
#     *OPTIONS*
#   }
#   hosts_Y2() {
#     *OPTIONS*
#   }
#   ...
#   ;;
# X2)
#   hosts_Y1() {
#     ...
#   ;;
# *)
#   <case of unknown current machine, so fail here>
#   ;;
# esac
#
# The OPTIONS will be one of the following very short recipes
#
# (1)   MODE=LOCAL
# The target is the same architecture as the current machine, so just use
# it in a simple direct manner.
#
# (2)   MODE=ssh; HOST=remote.machine.name
# Use ssh (which must have been set up with passwordless public key
# authentication) so that the build is done on the specified remote machine,
# which is liable to be one that has as its architecture the one toi be built
# for.
#
# (3)  MODE=ssh+ssh; HOST1=gateway.machine.name; HOST2=remote.machine.name
# Much like just "ssh" but uses the first machine as a gatway through which
# the one you will use can be reached.
#
# (4)   MODE=virtual; VM=machine-name
# Oracle VirtualBox must be installed on the current machine, and it must have
# a development-ready VM called machine-name installed. This machine must
# support passwordless ssh access from the current world using the userid
# that you are logged in under.
#
# (5)   MODE=utm; VM=machine-name
# This is only relevent if you are hosting on a Macintosh, in which case
# it used the UTM virtualiser (which is a wrapoped around qemu). Here
# the virtual machine must have a user called "reduce" that will accept
# passwordless access from where you are.  Note that the VM is controlled
# using "utmctl" and that only works when run directly on the Mac. Well
# if you are accessing the Mac terminal that you use to launch mk-snapshots.sh
# that will fail unless you use some scheme such as /usr/bin/screen to make
# it appear to macOS that you are sitting directly connected to it rather
# then at a distance.
#
# (6)   MODE=ssh+virtual; HOST=remote.machine; VM=virtual.on.remote
# Access a remote machine using SSH and then run virtualbox on it!
#
# (7)   MOD=ssh+utm is NOT available because of the constraints on how
#       utmctl can be used.
#
# (8)   MODE=altlocal, ssh+altlocal, ssh+ssh+altlocal
# There may be cases where it is possible run run commands using an
# alternative operating system in a container or somewhat equivalent
# scheme. For instance with Linux this may involve booting an alternative
# system using systemd/nspawn. It is also possible that it could cover
# emulation. If things can be set such that there is a special command
# "altlocal" such that issuing the command "altlocal C" obeys the command
# C in the alternate world than this option make it possible to take
# advantage of it. At the time of writing this I do not have a concrete
# useful instance of this (!), but a few months ago I could use it to
# have one Raspberry Pi computer supporting both 32 and 64-bit builds.
# So this depends on provision of soem script "altlocal" that does something
# interesting!
#
# The file here is the one that I could be using as of February 2026 and
# shows something of the range of computers I have tried to support and the
# ways in which they link together - in the process including instances of
# each of the above. A minimal script that just ran on a single host and
# that only supported a few targets would of course be a lot shorter and
# those cut-down versions are what I typically actually use. So this file
# is mostly for documentation.
#
# When you install this as $HOME/.spapshots you may wish to delete all the
# comments down to here!
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This file customises the Reduce snapshot builder by indicating private
# or local machines that can be used for building snapshots. For each
# system for which a snapshot may be generated there is a function here
# called "hosts_<architecture>". This can test the identify of the machine
# it is running on (so that a user can put exactly the same .snapshots files
# on multiple computers - I expect that this will generally simplify
# maintenance). It then sets a variable MODE together with some further
# variables.

# It can use this to override the snapshot building regime for macintosh,
# windows, linux64 (ie x86_64), rpi (ie a Raspberry Pi running 32-bit
# Raspberry Pi OS) and rpi64.
#
# It does not need to override all of these.
#
# So a very simple file content would be if a Windows machine was available
# as a server, but otherwise default behaviour was wanted. In that case this
# file might contain just
#     hosts_windows() {
#       MODE=ssh
#       HOST=windows.machine.some.network
#     }
# where the HOST setting gives the network identity of the Windows server -
# which will be accessed using ssh.
#
# It is possible to set PORT here to indicate a port to be used in redirection
# when accessing a virtual machine. However doing so is not especially
# recommended because the main script takes steps to choose a port that
# it has just detected as not being in use.
#
# When remote systems are accessed using ssh it is required that public key
# authentication without the need for further manual intervention is set up so
# that commends such as
#     ssh remote.host.machine some-command
# are executed without any need to quote further passwords. This may be
# achieved using the .ssh/authorized_keys scheme and possibly using the
# ssh-agent. 
#
# More elaborate options are illustrated in what follows:

case `uname -n` in
