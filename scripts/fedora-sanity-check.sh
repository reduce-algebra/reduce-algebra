# Install all packages needed for REDUCE development
# on a Fedora Workstation spin.

# When I started with a minimal install of Fedora 26 I installed
# vim, openssh and subversion manually - I could then fetch first
# fetchreduce.sh from another of my machines and then use that to
# invoke subversion to grab all of Reduce - including this script.
# Running this script seemed to get enough installed that I could
# configure and build Reduce. But PLEASE NOTE that Fedora packaging
# could change without me being aware, or changes to Reduce might
# add extra needs that I fail to include here, so if you get a build
# failure because of some missing header file or library first try
# to identify a package to install to satisfy the dependancy. Then report
# to the Reduce mailing lists so tha thos script can catch up.
