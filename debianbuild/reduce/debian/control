Description: REDUCE Computer Algebra System -- common files
 REDUCE is a system for doing scalar, vector and matrix algebra by computer,
 which also supports arbitrary precision numerical approximation and
 interfaces to gnuplot to provide graphics. It can be used interactively
 for simple calculations (as illustrated in the screenshot above) but also
 provides a full programming language, with a syntax similar to other
 modern programming languages.
 .
 This package contains the complete set of files for CSL and PSL Reduce.

Description: REDUCE Computer Algebra System -- CSL version
 REDUCE is a system for doing scalar, vector and matrix algebra by computer,
 which also supports arbitrary precision numerical approximation and
 interfaces to gnuplot to provide graphics. It can be used interactively
 for simple calculations (as illustrated in the screenshot above) but also
 provides a full programming language, with a syntax similar to other
 modern programming languages.

 This package contains the files for the CSL (Codemist Standard Lisp)
 version of REDUCE.
