This directory contains everything necessary to build Debian/Ubuntu
packages for REDUCE. To use it, you should have already installed the 
packages

  devscripts

  alien
  autoconf
  fakeroot
  libffi-dev
  libx11-dev
  libxext-dev
  libxft-dev
  texlive-latex-base
  texlive-fonts-extra
  texlive-latex-recommended
  texlive-fonts-recommended
  tex4ht
  debhelper 

To build the packages, run the following commands from the debianbuild
directory:

  make clean
  make

After successful completion, you should have several .deb package files,
the correspondung .rpm files, and .tgz for simple unpacking. In addition,
a file

  reduce-freestanding_<date>_<arch>.tar.bz2

containing the current snapshot, for those who do not have the priviledge
of installing a .deb or .rpm package.

You may check the package content with, e.g.,

  dpkg --contents reduce-common_20120514_i386.deb

Install the package with

  dpkg --install reduce-common_20120514_i386.deb

The CSL and PSL versions of REDUCE are run with

  /usr/bin/redpsl 

and 
  
  /usr/bin/redcsl
  [/usr/bin/bootstrapreduce, /usr/bin/csl]

respectively.
