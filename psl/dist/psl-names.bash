# Revisions:
#
# Mar 18 1987 (Harold Carr & Leigh Stoller)
#  Moved the machine-dependent names to xxx-names.
# Dec 21 1986 (Leigh Stoller)
#  cl variable should reference=$proot, not ~psl.
# Dec  6 1986 (Leigh Stoller)
#  Changed proot from /v/misc/psl3.4 to /v/misc/psl.

# Define the variables for easy access to psl sub-directories
# This file must be edited to reflect local installation choices of
# the root of the psl directory structure, proot
# and any other directories that by local convention are moved
# from subtrees of=$proot to other locations.

# All of these variables are set in the environment, so they are accessible
# from within scripts and PSL itself as dollarsign-variables "$var".
# Since the environment is inherited, it is only necessary to source psl-names
# once in your .login file, rather than in the .cshrc for every c-shell.
