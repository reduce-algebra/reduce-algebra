% 22 Oct 1984 2202-PDT (Brian Beach)
%  Fixed DS so that is undertands non-proper lists as in the case
%  (DS FOO (x) (CONS x '(A . B))).  Removed internal functions.
% 26 Jan 1984 0958-PST (Brian Beach)
%  Corrected file name in header.
% 01-Dec-83 14:28:47 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.

  % ---------------------------------------
  % Type: MACRO
  % A convenient syntax for a simple macro definition, known as an SMACRO.
  % The syntax of DS is similar to DE, except that a MACRO is defined instead

  % of an EXPR, e.g.
  %	(DS FOO (A B) (BAR A B))
  % is equivalent to:
  %	(DM FOO (U) (LIST 'BAR (CADR U) (CADDR U))).
  % The "implicit ProgN" is allowed when using Lisp syntax.  DS is invoked
  % with Rlisp syntax as the procedure type SMACRO, e.g.
  %	SMACRO PROCEDURE FOO(A, B); BAR(A, B);
  % produces the above Lisp form.
