% Revisions:
%
% 22-Nov-94 (Herbert Melenk)
%   Rebind progbody* on entry to an interpreted function such that illegal
%   GO and RETURN statements are better detected by the interpreter. 
% 20-Oct-92 (Herbert Melenk)
%   Added stackmarkforbacktrace as dummy parameter such that the compiler 
%   does not remove the btr-tag information from stack.
%  1-Oct-88 (Tony Hearn)
%   Replaced single call of getfntype by (get fn 'type) so that putd-getd
%   module not needed to execute this module.
% 31-May-84 10:43:21 (Brian Beach)
%  Calls on IDAPPLY1 --> IDAPPLY.
% 29-Mar-84 13:50:04 (Mike Creech)
%   Added IDAPPLY for use when compiler does not optimize to opencode or when
%   interpreting.
% 01-Dec-83 14:42:43 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
