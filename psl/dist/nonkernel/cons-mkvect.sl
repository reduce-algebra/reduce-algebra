% Revisions:
%
% 2-July-91 (Winfried Neun)
%  Added lap versions of cons, xcons and ncons.
% 07-May-84 07:27:46 (Brian Beach)
%  Added Mike's MAKE-MANUAL-EVECTOR
% 24-Feb-84 08:24:09 (Brian Beach)
%  Make into a loadable file.  Removed definition of CONS, since CONS is now
%  in the kernel.  DePROGged.
% 01-Dec-83 14:25:23 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
