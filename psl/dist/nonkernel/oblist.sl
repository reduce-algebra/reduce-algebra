% Revisions:
%
% 19-Dec-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added copystring to setq of stringgensym* below to make sure the string
%  in allocated in heap, not bps.
% 25-Sep-84 14:01:33 (Brian Beach)
%  Fixed ID-INTERN yet again.  This time a special case was added for sigle
%  character id's, since they are not entered in the hash table.
% 24-Sep-84 14:27:05 (Brian Beach)
%  Fixed ID-INTERN yet again so that interning an ID which has a print name
%  of an already interned ID will return that already interned ID.
% 21-Sep-84 13:14:49 (Brian Beach)
%  Added following change:
% 28-Jun-84 10:43:14 (Cris Perdue)
%  Added startup time copyd from intern to reader-intern.
%  Reader-intern was added as a hook for the pkg system.
% 22-Aug-84 08:38:50 (Brian Beach)
%  Fixed ID-INTERN so that the ID created has the same ID number as the one
%  being interned.
% 18-Jul-84 08:36:24 (Brian Beach)
%  Reintroduced internal functions.  Minor cleanup.
% 23-Mar-84 07:32:21 (Brian Beach)
%  Removed duplicate definitions of functions defined in the kernel.  Added
%  compile time load of HASH-DECLS.
% 01-Dec-83 14:55:01 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
