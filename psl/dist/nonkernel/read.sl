% Revisions:
%
% 27-May-87 (Harold Carr & Leigh Stoller)
%  Added fluid declaration of in* and out*.
% 31-Dec-84 11:04:11 (Cris Perdue)
%  Added second argument to channelreadvector since it is passed
%  two, being a read macro.
% 31-May-84 10:53:10 (Brian Beach)
%  Call on IDAPPLY2 --> IDAPPLY.
% 01-Dec-83 15:01:01 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
