% Revisions:
%
% 27-May-87 (Harold Carr & Leigh Stoller)
%  Added global declaration of $eol$.
% 11-Aug-84 (Brian Beach)
%  Changed linelength of channel 2 (bldmsg channel) to 0 (infinity).  This
%  Prevents the insertion of extraneous linefeeds in built messages.
% 4-May-84 11:20:48 (Brian Beach)
%  Translated from RLISP to LISP.
% Edit by Russ Fish, Mon Feb 27 21:02:56 1984
%  Converted to system-independent I/O package, constants to io-const.red .
% MLGriss, 9 July 1983
%       Added TerminalWriteChar as "standard" function
%       Renamed TerminalOutputHandler to TerminalWriteChar
%       Added PAGEPOSITION warray
