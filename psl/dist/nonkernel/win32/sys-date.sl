% Revisions:
%
% 17-Jul-84 22:52:31 (RAM)
%  Changed allocation of datebuffer from warray declaration to a call on
%  gtwarray (the compiler was emitting bad code for declare-warray on
%  non-kernel modules).
%  Changed call of function time to a call of function external_time.
%  Time is defined in top-loop.sl, and was conflicting, now that this time
%  is not flagged as a foreignfunction.
%  Removed many prog nil constructs and reformatted comments.
