% Revisions:
%
% 04-Sep-91 (Herbert Melenk)
%  assembly version without alloc
% 15-Oct-90 (Russ Fish)
% Yanked out the obsolete IRIS code in equal and eqn.
% 26-May-87 (Harold Carr & Leigh Stoller)
%  Made equal and eqn aware of IEEE negative zero (via zerop).
% 24-Apr-87 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added if-system for IRIS floating point compares in equal and eqn.
% 18-Jul-84 08:26:37 (Brian Beach)
%  Fixed bug in equal comparing bytes.
% 10-May-84 14:15:24 (Brian Beach)
%  <PSL.KERNEL>EQUAL.RED.3,  6-Feb-84 10:28:57, Edit by KESSLER
%  As per Hearn - EQUAL gives incorrect results for BIGNUMS - Changed
%  wordsequal and halfwordsequal.  Wasn't checking the last element.
%  
% 22-Mar-84 11:22:01 (Brian Beach)
%  Fixed constants, tag names.
% 01-Dec-83 14:37:31 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
