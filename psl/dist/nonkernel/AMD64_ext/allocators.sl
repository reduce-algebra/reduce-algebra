% Revisions:
%
% 06-APR-88 (Julian Padget)
%  Reinstated allocators mentioned below.
% 21-Dec-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added try-other-bps-spaces function and support for it in delbps.
% 03 Sep 1986 (Julian Padget)
%  Added allocators for bvectors and contexts (funargs are done with
%  CONS and bstructs are not allocated.
% 03-Jul-84 10:09:24 (Jim Ambras/CRC)
%  Modified get-heap-try-reclaim to use stderror instead of kernel-fatal-error
%   so the kernel won't terminate when heap space is exhausted.
% 23-Feb-84 15:40:14 (Brian Beach)
%  Removed everything that is in the kernel.  (This file will now be FASLed in)
% 21-Feb-84 09:52:00 (Steve Lowder)
%  Removed all useage of wvar, wconst, warray, wstring.
% 03-Jan-84 18:25:44 (Cris Perdue)
%  Fixed some comments, made gtbps grab no space if the block
%  requested is too big to give.
% 02-Dec-83 09:32:39 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
%                                                                          
% 5 Nov 83, Swanson and Perdue                                             
%  Changed mention of PDP10 to mention the new system attribute            
%  OneSpaceGC.  Added special code for Extended 20.                        
%  <PSL.KERNEL>ALLOCATORS.RED.7, 23-Mar-83 11:35:37, Edit by KESSLER       
%  Added OldHeapTrapBound to exported WVars, so we can update the heap trap
%  bound upon switch.                                                      
% Edit by Cris Perdue, 16 Feb 1983 1834-PST                                
% Pre-GC trap, known-free-space fns                                        
%  <PSL.KERNEL>ALLOCATORS.RED.4, 10-Jan-83 15:50:50, Edit by PERDUE
