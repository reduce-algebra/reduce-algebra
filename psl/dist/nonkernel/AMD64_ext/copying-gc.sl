% Revisions:
%
%  20-July-89 (Winfried Neun)
%  Made heapsize enlargeable for 2 space collector. Will be enlarged auto-
%  matically by heapenlarge* items if not more than heap-warn-level is free
%  Added function (set-heap-size items)
%  20-June-89 (Winfried Neun)
%  Added handling of symget vector, modification in copyitem1
%  2-June-89 (Winfried Neun)
%  Changed message format again, copyfromstack now allows a bignum to point to
%  a hwords tag item (formerly a hvect item) for nbig30.
%  10-March-89 (Winfried Neun)
%  Fixed bug with timing(oldtime), new message formats in gcstats and cfserror.
%  1-Sep-88 (Julian Padget)
%  Changed system fluid variables to global.
% 16-Jun-87 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added Mark Swanson's hack to the GC that ignores bogus stack items.
% 10-Dec-1986 (Tim Mueller)
%  Fixed bug in reclaim2() where oldHeapLowerBound
%   might be equal to heapUpperBound (changed > to >=).
% 9 Oct 1986 - Fix by Russ Fish and Tim Mueller to eliminate device dependent
% code in reclaim2 where null objects are detected.  Also can now repeat
% reclaim2's.
% 6-Feb-86 08:10:09 (Mark Swanson)
%  put in some NIL checks (strictly) for speed;  took out a gratuitous
%  putmem in the non-pointertag case of copyitem
% 6-Feb-86 07:15:59 (Mark Swanson)
%  changed calls on copyfrombase to copyitem, since that's all former
%  did was to call the latter anyway
% 5-Feb-86 21:54:00 (Mark Swanson)
%  Added RECLAIM2 for static heap from 3.2 implementation.
% 24-Jul-84 08:29:01 (Brian Beach)
%  Changed names of tags for micro-kernel.
%  Removed uses of CONST.
% 3 Jul 1984 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Changed references to the constant forward to forward-tag, to match
%  the declaration in tags
% 26 Jan 1984 0958-PST (Brian Beach)
%  Corrected file name in header.

%
% Old Revision history:
%
% 14 Dec 83 (Cris Perdue)
%  Added handling of BYTES and HALFWORDS to this version.
% Edit by Mark Swanson, 3 April 1983 0949-MST
% Made COPYITEM1 tail-recursive so that long lists can be copied without
% stack overflow -- both COPYITEM and COPYITEM1 are now called exclusively
% for their side effects--return values should be ignored.
% Edit by Cris Perdue, 25 Mar 1983 1711-PST
% Occurrence of heap-warn-level in initialization no longer flagged
% with "LispVar".  Didn't work.
%  <PSL.KERNEL>COPYING-GC.RED.2, 23-Mar-83 11:35:37, Edit by KESSLER
%  Add HeadTrapBound Guys, so we can update the heap trap bound upon switch
% Edit by Cris Perdue, 15 Mar 1983 0937-PST
% Added missing comma as noted by Kessler.
% Edit by Cris Perdue, 16 Feb 1983 1409-PST
% Removed external declaration of HeapPreviousLast (the only occurrence)
% Now using "known-free-space" function and heap-warn-level
% Sets HeapTrapped to NIL now.
% Added check of Heap!-Warn!-Level after %Reclaim.
%  <PSL.KERNEL>COPYING-GC.RED.6,  4-Oct-82 17:56:49, Edit by BENSON
%  Added GCTime!*
