% Revisions:
%
% 29-Sep-91 (Herbert Melenk)
%  DOS: compile putd calls for nonkernel and kernel functions
% 01-Oct-88 (Tony Hearn)
%  Replaced single use of flag1/remflag1 by flag/remflag to make module
%  less dependent on non-SL functions.
% 23-May-84 16:16:15 (Mike Creech)
%  Rewrote code-number-of-arguments to deal with functions that were
%  defined to have any number of arguments (-1 in *entry definition).
%  Reformatted PUTD to make more readable.
%  Rewrote remd to be more readable.
%  Reformatted getd to be more readable (and changed u => func).
% 01-Dec-83 14:59:44 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
