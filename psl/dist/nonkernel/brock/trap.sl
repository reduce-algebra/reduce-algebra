% Revisions:
%
% 17-Feb-89 (Chris Burdorf)
%  Use sun3_sigset for os/4.
% 09-Oct-87 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Do not call build-trap-message anymore. It is too flakey to be relied
%   on to tell the truth.
% 31-Apr-87 (Leigh Stoller)
%  After consult with Julian Padget, altered sigunwind to decrease the
%   stack frame by 320 bytes instead of 98. The interrupted address is
%   found 312 bytes into this frame.
% 18-Aug-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Reworked so that signals can be added more easily. Also added calls to
%  external functions which set up the trap, and reinit the trap after a
%  signal is recieved.
% 2-Jan-85 10:21:47 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Instead of just calling stderror with a message about the kind of trap,
%  we now find the name of the routine that caused the trap and report
%  that as well.  CODE-ADDRESS-TO-SYMBOL is used to figure out the name.
% 27-Dec-84 10:55:56 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Added sigunwind, to pop the signal handler's stack frame before calling
%  stderror.  (Many thanks to Jim Davis for deciphering the contents of this
%  frame.)
% 17-Dec-84 10:24:41 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Added lots more signals to catch, to try to prevent those occasional
%  dumps out of Nmode.
