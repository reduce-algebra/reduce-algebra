% Revisions:
%
% 31-Jan-1990 (Winfried Neun)
% added set-bndstk-size feature
% 31-Aug-88 (Julian Padget)
%  Bnd... declarations changed from fluid to global.
% 06-Mar-84 17:11:53 (Jim Ambras/CRC)
%  Uppded binding stack size from 4000 to 8000 for REDUCE.
% 02-Mar-84 09:29:17 (Jim Ambras/CRC)
%  Corrected file header.
% 16-Jan-84 14:11:00 (Tim Tillson)
%  Upped binding stack size from 2000 to 4000 for unknown (and possibly buggy?)
%  reasons to build NMODE successfully.
% 01-Dec-83 14:16:18 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
