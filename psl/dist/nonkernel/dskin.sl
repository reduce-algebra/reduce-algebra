% Revisions:

% 10 May 1996 (Winfried Neun)
%  Rebound *echo to nil in lapin again...
% 20 Oct 1986 (Russ Fish)
%  Fix dskin-file so it works for lisp syntax sources under an rlisp toploop.
% 27-Oct-84 12:11 (Brian Beach)
%  Added (ON FAST-INTEGERS) so that the + function will work.
% 02-Oct-84 09:23:37 (Alan Snyder)
%  Incompatible changes:
%    Removed processing of EVAL and IGNORE flags, which has been moved to
%    FASLOUT.SL (for proper interaction with macroexpansion); programs other
%    than the compiler that require processing of these flags now must do it
%    themselves.  Made LAPIN more like DSKIN; in particular, it no longer
%    binds *REDEFMSG and *ECHO to NIL.  The function DSKINEVAL no longer
%    exists.
%  Benign cleanup:
%    Completely restructured, using various levels of "internal" functions.
%    Now uses ERRSET instead of ERRORSET.  Removed PACKAGE attribute from the
%    file header.
%  Improved error handling:
%    Added error message for abort caused by errors.  Added unwind-protect to
%    ensure that the input stream is closed.  Added ABORT return value in case
%    dskin is aborted.
%  Support for multiple dialects:
%    Now uses the global variables TOPLOOPREAD*, TOPLOOPEVAL*, and
%    TOPLOOPPRINT* to determine which READ, EVAL, and PRINT functions to
%    invoke.  Added optional termination function argument (to DSKIN-FILE).
%    Introduce a function MODELESS-DSKIN-FILE to make redefinition by
%    DSKIN-MODE.SL easier.
% 01-Dec-83 14:29:08 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.

%  <PSL.KERNEL>DSKIN.RED.2,  5-Oct-82 11:32:28, Edit by BENSON
