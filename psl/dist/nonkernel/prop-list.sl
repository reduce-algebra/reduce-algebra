% Revisions:
%
% 31-Dec-84 10:52:18 (Cris Perdue)
%  Changed remprop to remove the property from the property list
%  unconditionally so storage for properties with values of NIL
%  is released.
% 21-Mar-84 14:45:02 (Jim Ambras)
%  Removed turning on of fast-links flag
% 26 Jan 1984 1001-PST (Brian Beach)
%  Corrected file name in header.
% 01-Dec-83 14:59:17 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
%
% Edit by Cris Perdue, 21 Apr 1983 1345-PST
% Flag now gives error if IDList not NIL or list.
%  <PSL.INTERP>PROPERTY-LIST.RED.11,  1-Mar-82 14:09:20, Edit by BENSON
%  Changed "move-to-front" to "exchange-with-previous"
%  <PSL.INTERP>PROPERTY-LIST.RED.7, 27-Feb-82 12:43:27, Edit by BENSON
%  Optimized GET and FLAGP, rearranges property list
% Every ID in the system has a property list.  It is obtained by the function
% PROP(ID) and updated with the function SETPROP(ID, PLIST).  These functions
% are not in the Standard Lisp report, and are not intended for use in user
% programs.  A property list (whose format should also not be known to
% user programs) is a list of IDs and dotted pairs (A-List entries).  The
% pairs are used by PUT and GET, and the IDs are used by FLAG and FLAGP.
% Non-Standard Lisp functions used:
% DELQIP -- EQ, destructive version of Delete	(in EASY-NON-SL.RED)
% ATSOC -- EQ version of ASSOC	(in EASY-NON-SL.RED)
% DELATQIP -- EQ, destructive version of DELASC (in EASY-NON-SL.RED)
% EQCAR(A,B) -- PairP A and car A eq B (in EASY-NON-SL.RED)
% NonIDError -- in TYPE-ERRORS.RED
