% Revisions:
%
% 10-May-84 14:25:16 (Brian Beach)
%   12-Mar-84 13:17:04 (Mike Creech)
%     Fixed bug I introduced in UPBV.
%   26-Jan-84 13:56:29 (Mike Creech)
%     Fixed bugs with vector functions used where evector functions should be used
%     (i.e., veclen, vecitm, and vecinf).
%     Removed EVECTORP.
%  
% 26-Apr-84 07:50:39 (Brian Beach)
%  Removed EVECTORP.  Moved it to KNOWN-TO-COMP-SL.
% 01-Dec-83 15:05:03 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
% 14 Jun 1983 1103-PDT, Cris Perdue
%   Added assign-op property and setf-safe flag to egetv.
%  <PSL.KERNEL>VECTORS.RED.2, 10-Jan-83 15:54:19, Edit by PERDUE
%  Added EGetV etc. for EVectors, paralleling Vectors
% MkVect and MkEVector are found in PK:CONS-MKVECT.RED
