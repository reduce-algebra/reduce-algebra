% Revisions:

% 4-Jul-85 Edited by Connie O'Dell to install fix for uninitialized vectors
%  in totalCopy proposed by Will Galway, to prevent unpleasant consequences
%  of garbage collecting while part of copy structure is uninitialized.
% 19 Oct 1984 0616-PDT (Mark R. Swanson)
%  Modified length calculation in COPYSTRINGTOFROM to take count word out of 
%   consideration
% 18-Jul-84 08:08:34 (Brian Beach)
%  Minor cleanup of TOTALCOPY
% 01-Dec-83 14:26:58 (Brian Beach)
