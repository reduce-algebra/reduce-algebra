% Revisions:
%
% 6 October 1990 (Winfried Neun)
%  Changed lap code for MC 88000 processor
% 22 Oct 1984 2101-PDT (Brian Beach)
%  At the suggestion of Alan Snyder, changed throw so that throwing to
%  an uncaught tag does not produce a continuable error.  It is thought that
%  a throw should NEVER return.  Also, removed internal functions.
% 22-Mar-84 09:39:39 (Brian Beach)
%  Fixed constants.
% 01-Dec-83 14:22:26 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
