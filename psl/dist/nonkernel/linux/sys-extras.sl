% Revisions:
%
% 25-Aug-87 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added definition of external-allocatemorebps to map to allocatemorebps.
%   Vax nameing convention fix.
% 29-May-87 (Leigh Stoller & Harold Carr)
%  Added setenv function.
% 28-May-87 (Leigh Stoller & Harold Carr)
%  Added unix-time function for pcls.
% 02-Sep-86 (Harold Carr)
%  Made QUIT call exit-with-status with 0 instead of doing a
%  (throw 'reset 'quit).  (throw 'reset 'quit) makes it impossible to
%  make special PSLs with initcode to do some work and then call
%  (exitlisp) or (quit).  The initcode is evaluated before the reset
%  tag is in place.
% 01-Sep-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Modified the system function to call an external C routine that does
%  makes the actual call to system and returns the value.
% 19-Aug-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added the filestatus function.
% 03-Aug-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Modified the quit function so that it looks at the break loop level to
%  determine if a nonzero status should be returned to the OS.
% 2-Jan-85 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Now that system signal-handler frames are popped from the stack, deref
%  isn't necessary, so it was removed.
% 21-Dec-84 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Added new check to returnaddressp: it now calls a function "deref",
%  which invokes the C routine "dereference" to find out if dereferencing
%  an address is safe.
% 14-Nov-84 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Changed returnaddressp to check for address >= 2000, to account
%  for HP-UX mapping above ROM.
% 17-Jul-84 23:13:12 (RAM)
%  Removed coredump routines because they kept getting in the way.
%  Changed call to chdir to a call on unixcd, to incorporate expand_file_name.
% 12 June 84 (Vicki O'Day)                                                 
%  Added routines to turn coredumps on and off, with the help of           
%  a super-user owned "createcore" program.                                
% 11-May-84 10:00:00 (Vicki O'Day)                                         
%  Changed system to call nof_system, a no-fork version.                   
%  This is part of Bill Watkins' escape-to-shell mechanism.                
% 27-Feb-84 16:52:12 (RAM)                                                 
%  Pathin the appropriate files for HPUX200.                               
%  Set system_list* to reasonable HPUX200 default.                         
%  Modified quit, exitlisp, and returnaddressp to do right things.         
%  Added system function, like elsewhere on VAX version.                   
%  Changed all references to _filepointerofchannel to channeltable.        
%  Changed call to byte in importforeignstring to getbyte since byte not   
%  defined yet.                                                            
%  Fixed some bugs in getstartupname.                                      
% 2-Dec-83  16:00:00 (Brian Beach)                                         
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.                                         
%
