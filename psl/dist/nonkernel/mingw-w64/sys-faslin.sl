% Revisions:
%
% 06-Apr-88 (Julian Padget)
%  Must do (wgetv symval <expr>) in CPSL.
% 4-Dec-84 15:05:34 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Added binaryopenupdate.
% 26-Sep-84 13:41:32 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Added binaryopenappend for use with Nmail.
% 27-Jul-84 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Added redefinition of binaryopenread, so if it fails it can call
%  conterror instead of kernel-fatal-error.
% 10-Jul-84 13:35:24 (RAM)
%  Replaced call to fopen with call to unixopen.  Unixopen will expand
%  shell variables (and some other fancy stuff).
% 2-Jul-84 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Removed functions in kernel.
% 27-Feb-84 17:00:24 (RAM)
%  Changed File and Title entries in header.
%  Added flagging as foreignfunction of fopen, fclose, putw,
%  fread, fwrite, fseek.
% 2-Dec-83  16:00:00 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
