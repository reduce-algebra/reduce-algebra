% Revisions:
%
% 27-Mar-84 13:56:06 (Jim Ambras/CRC)
%  Changed use of idloc to id2int.  Added compiletime load of sys-consts.
% 02-Mar-84 09:19:52 (Jim Ambras/CRC)                                      
%  Corrected file header.

%  Modified for the D-register model; plant routines moved to LAP.SL       
% 02-Dec-83 10:14:03 (Jim Ambras)                                          
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.                                         
% 15-Jul-83 Steve Lowder                                                   
%  Changed three *WTimes2 expressions for (WConst 6) to adds because *WTimes2
%  is no longer a cmacro.                                                  
% 1-Jul-83 Steve Lowder                                                    
%  Changed expressions (displacement (reg 1) 0) to (indirect (reg 1)) to   
%  improve code generation.
