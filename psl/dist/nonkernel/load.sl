% Revisions:
%
% 22-Jun-2006 (Winfried Neun) Added modulep.
%
% 17-Feb-89 (Chris Burdorf)
% Redefined faslin-bad-file so that it prints the file name.
%
% 21-May-87 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Incorporated addload function from utilities at Alpha1 request.
% 10-May-84 14:29:22 (Brian Beach)
%   7 Mar 1984 1632-PST (Nancy Kendzierski, Cris Perdue)
%    Rewrote LOAD1.  Now understands loads-in-progress, gives better warning
%    messages, and correctly completes loading and importing of files for a
%    module before believing loading is complete.
% 01-Dec-83 14:50:16 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
