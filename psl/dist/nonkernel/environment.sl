% This file defined the macro (DEFINE-GLOBAL) which is used to define
% the global variables which describe the environment.
%
% The rest of the file contains examples of the environment variables which
% should be set up on a system--by-system basis.

% The following global variables should denote either a string or NIL.
% These variables are normally initialized upon startup
% possibly from a standard configuration file.
