% Revisions:
%
% 05-Oct-87 (Harold Carr)
%  Added call to GETUNIXARGS to SYSCLEARIO to make consistent with VAX.
% 31-Mar-87 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added calls to setlinebuf back in. This should be in all systems just in
%   line buffering is a problem.
% 15-Feb-85 13:27:04 (Brian Beach)
%  Commented out the setlinebuf calls in syscleario.
% 17-Dec-84 11:14:32 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Uncommented out the setlinebuf calls in syscleario.
% 10-Jul-84 13:30:58 (RAM)
%  Replaced calls to fopen with call to unixopen.  Unixopen will expand
%  shell variables (and some other fancy stuff).
% 21-May-84 (Vicki O'Day)                                                  
%  Added unixcleario call to syscleario.  This is so buffers that are      
%  dirty when a savesystem is done will be cleared.                        
% 4-May-84 11:16:33 (Brian Beach)                                          
%  Added VAXREADCHAR and VAXWRITECHAR to the version received from Utah.   
%  These are needed for RAWIO.                                             
%  Translated from RLISP to LISP.                                          
% Edit by Russ Fish, Wed Dec 21 17:10:07 1983                              
%  Force line buffering on StdOut and StdErr in SysClearIO even if file output.
%

% Each individual system must have the following routines defined.         
% SysClearIo, SysOpenRead, SysOpenWrite, SysReadRec, SysWriteRec, SysClose,
% SysMaxBuffer

%   The following definitions are used in the routines:

%    FileName - A Lisp string of the file name.                            
% FileDescriptors in the Unix version are "FILE *" (pointers to C "standard
% I/O" stream structs, as defined in /usr/include/stdio.h.)
