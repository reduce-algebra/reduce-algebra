% Revisions:
%
% 10-Dec 90   (Winfried Neun)
%  Adapted for IBM Rs 6000
% 05-Feb-1987 (Leigh Stoller & Harold Carr)
%  Removed load of vax-environ from pxnk-files list.
% 11-Dec-1986 (Tim Mueller)
%  Removed call to loader-main at the end of the file since loader-main
%  is called in main-start after loading the kernel.
% Tue Oct  8 05:56:55 1985 (Russ Fish)
%  Removed hardwired path to $pnkl from filenames, since the make-bare-psl
%  script cd's to $pnkl before starting bpsl.
% 16-Dec-84 08:30 (Brian Beach)
%  Added VAX-ENVIRONMENT. Removed CHAR-MACRO.
