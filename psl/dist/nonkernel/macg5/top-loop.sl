% Revisions:
%
% 01-Oct-88  (Tony Hearn)
%  Replaced prin2t by prin2/terpri to reduce dependence on non-SL functions.
% 09-Jun-87 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Moved the initialization of *redefmsg from pre-main to a top-level form.
% 04-Jun-87 (Harold Carr)
%  Installed Mark Swanson's updated HIST.  His comments:
%  HIST does properly initialize historylist*.  This is due to its (supposed)
%  invocation within the toploop after the toploop has done (history-append).
%  The following version of hist performs (hist 'clear) without bus errors,
%  something of an improvement over the original.
% 26-May-87 (Leigh Stoller & Harold Carr)
%  Interchanged calls to evalinitforms and initializeinterrupts so
%   initializeinterrupts is done before trying evaluate any forms.
% 21-Dec-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Savesystem now checks the fluid using-other-bps-spaces*. Do not want to
%   unexec if we added bps after heap.
% 06-Dec-84 14:23 (Brian Beach)
%  Added call to INITIALIZEINTERRUPTS to PRE-MAIN.
% 27-Oct-84 11:58 (Brian Beach)
%  Added default values for TOPLOOPPRINT*, TOPLOOPREAD*, and TOPLOOPEVAL* in
%  PRE-MAIN.
% 23-Oct-84 14:50:15 (Alan Snyder)
%  Fix problem introduced in 02-Oct-84 change: Unfortunately, in the current
%  implementation of the package system, PACKAGE-NAME (used in
%  COMPUTE-PROMPT-STRING) is a macro.  As a temporary workaround, evaluate the
%  invocation at execution time.
% 18-Oct-84 10:46:26 (Alan Snyder)
%  Fix bug introduced into TOP-LOOP: $EOF$ should not be quoted.  Fix bug
%  introduced in 02-Oct-84 change: should not use "numeric operators" here.
% 02-Oct-84 09:22:45 (Alan Snyder)
%  Introduced functions HISTORY-STATE, SET-HISTORY-STATE, HISTORY-RESET,
%  HISTORY-APPEND, HISTORY-SET-INPUT, HISTORY-SET-OUTPUT, and HISTORY-FETCH
%  for explicitly manipulating the history list; revised PRE-MAIN, SAVESYSTEM,
%  and TOPLOOP to use these functions.  Introduced function
%  COMPUTE-PROMPT-STRING, used by TOPLOOP; changed the promptstring to include
%  information about *DEFN and *PACKAGE*, and to include an optional level
%  number rather than a huge number of angle brackets.  Removed processing of
%  EVAL and IGNORE flags, now in FASLOUT.SL (for proper interaction with
%  macroexpansion).  Changed HISTPRINT to pad with spaces instead of
%  outputting tab characters (doesn't seem reliable).  Cosmetic changes:
%  rearranged the source file to group related functions together.  Performed
%  further restructuring of TOPLOOP; the internal functions DEFNPRINT and
%  DEFNPRINT1 no longer exist.  Now uses ERRSET instead of ERRORSET.  Recoded
%  HIST and HISTPRINT; HISTPRINT no longer internal.  Removed PACKAGE
%  attribute from the file header.
% 17-Sep-84 09:25:37 (Brian Beach)
%  Moved variable initialization from MAIN to PRE-MAIN.  Some application 
%  programs (namely NMODE) redefine MAIN in order to customize the system.
% 6-Aug-84 16:00:00 (RAM)
%  Declared startuproutine* fluid.
% 05-Apr-84 14:21:01 (Brian Beach)
%  Cleaned up TOPLOOP function.  Added STARTUP-SYSTEM.
% 01-Dec-83 15:03:39 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
%
%  03-Mar-83  Nancy Kendzierski
%  Added declaration of LispScanTable!* as a fluid.
%  <PSL.KERNEL>TOP-LOOP.RED.6,  5-Oct-82 11:02:29, Edit by BENSON
%  Added EvalInitForms, changed SaveSystem to 3 args
%  <PSL.KERNEL>TOP-LOOP.RED.5,  4-Oct-82 18:09:33, Edit by BENSON
%  Added GCTime!*
%  $pi/top-loop.red, Mon Jun 28 10:54:19 1982, Edit by Fish
%  Conditional output: !*Output, Semic!*, !*NoNil.
%  <PSL.INTERP>TOP-LOOP.RED.13, 30-Apr-82 14:32:20, Edit by BENSON
%  Minor change to !*DEFN processing
%  <PSL.INTERP>TOP-LOOP.RED.5, 29-Apr-82 03:56:06, Edit by GRISS
%  Initial attempt to add !*DEFN processing
%<PSL.INTERP>TOP-LOOP.RED.18 24-Nov-81 15:22:25, Edit by BENSON
% Changed Standard!-Lisp to StandardLisp
%
% 01-Dec-83 15:03:39 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
