% Revisions:
% 31-Aug-88 (Julian Padget)
%  Changed second "fluid" call to "global" since there was no need of former.
% 01-Jun-87 (Leigh Stoller & Harold Carr)
%  Unbundled dumplisp.
% 19-Dec-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Unexec now moves the text/data boundary. See bps.c in the $pb directory
%   for a full explanation.
% 09-Dec-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Removed calls to expand_file_name and put them into c-code. Problems with
%   malloc. Commentted out seconf reclaim calls for copying-gc. This needs to
%   be looked at. Should be an easier way to switch.
% 24-Nov-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added calls to expand_file_name so that ~ and $ variables can be used in
%   .sl scripts to build bare-psl.
% 28-Dec-84 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Decided not to use nextbps; we may want to use shared Nmode
%  executables, and this would be very dangerous with some bps
%  in text area.
% 17-Oct-84 12:18:31 (RAM)
%  Now use NEXTBPS and HEAPLAST.  This works now that setupbpsandheap does
%  an initial malloc and free for some scratch space for library calls.
% 27-Feb-84 16:11:36 (RAM)
%  Print error messages from here, not from the foreign function unexec.
%  Don't call unexec with NEXTBPS and HEAPLAST (use 0's).  There seem to be
%  bugs when these are used.
