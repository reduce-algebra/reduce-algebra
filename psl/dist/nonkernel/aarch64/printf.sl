%                          Formatted print
%
% Format is a string, either in the heap or not, whose characters will be
% written on the currently selected output channel.  The exception to this is
% that when a % is encountered, the following character is interpreted as a
% format character, to decide how to print one of the other arguments.  The
% following format characters are currently supported:
%	%b - blanks; take the next argument as integer and print that many
%		blanks
%	%c - print the next argument as a single character
%	%d - print the next argument as a decimal integer
%       %e - EVALs the next argument for side-effect -- most useful if the
%            thing EVALed does some printing
%	%f - fresh-line, print end-of-line char if not at beginning of line
%	%l - same as %w, except lists are printed without top level parens
%	%n - print end-of-line character
%	%o - print the next argument as an octal integer
%	%p - print the next argument as a Lisp item, using Prin1
%       %r - print the next argument as a Lisp item, using ErrPrin (`FOO')
%	%s - print the next argument as a string
%	%t - tab; take the next argument as an integer and
%		print spaces to that column
%	%w - print the next argument as a Lisp item, using Prin2
%	%x - print the next argument as a hexidecimal integer
%	%% - print a %
%
% If the character is not one of these (either upper or lower case), then an
% error occurs.
