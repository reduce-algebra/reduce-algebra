% Revisions:
%
% 27-May-87 (Harold Carr & Leigh Stoller)
%  Changed declaration of in* and out* from global to fluid.
% 20-Nov-84 13:14:53 (Brian Beach)
%  Changed INDEPENDENTWRITECHAR so that the buffer overflow is computed more
%  accurately.  The Number of characters in the buffer when the buffer is 
%  written should now be exactly equal to the declared buffer size (instead
%  of two more, as it has been in the past.)
% 17-Jul-84 14:00 (Brian Beach)
%  Added missing STRINF's.
% 31-May-84 09:13:29 (Brian Beach)
%  Removed if-system for Chipmunk that handled tabs.  Exported the code
%  to the system specific terminal driver (in PHPP:HP.TEXT).
% 27-Mar-84 14:48:03 (Jim Ambras/CRC)
%  Added compiletime load of io-decls.
% 02-Dec-83 10:42:46 (Jim Ambras)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%==============================================================================
%
% Each individual system must have the following routines defined.
%
%   The following definitions are used in the routines:
%    FileDescriptor - A machine dependent word that references a file once
%      opened; generated by the Open
%    FileName - A Lisp string of the file name.
%
%  FileDescriptor := SysOpenRead (Channel,FileName);
%                                             % Open FileName for input and
%      % return a file descriptor used
%      % in later references to the
%      % file. Channel used only
%                                             % if needed to generate FileDesc
%  FileDescriptor := SysOpenWrite (Channel,FileName);
%                                             % Open FileName for output and
%      % return a file descriptor used
%      % in later references to the
%      % file. Channel used only
%                                             % if needed to generate FileDesc
%  SysWriteRec (FileDescriptor, StringToWrite, StringLength);
%      % Write StringLength characters
%      % from StringToWrite from the
%      % first position.
%  LengthRead := SysReadRec (FileDescriptor, StringBuffer);
%      % Read from the FileDescriptor, a
%      %  record into the StringBuffer.
%      %  Return the length of the
%      %  string read.
%  SysClose (FileDescriptor);      % Close FileDescriptor, allowing
%      %  it to be reused.

%     2/24/84 - rrk We are getting an extra carriage return before printing
% the result of every evaluation of the top loop.  This is caused because
% of our method of handling prompts.  We write a prompt to the the
% promptout channel.  Write is the only thing that updates the lineposition
% numbers.  Thus, when we come around to printout the results, it looks
% like the prompt has reset the lineposition (length prompstring).  In some
% implementations, promptout and terminal out are the same channel, thus
% the call to posn returns something non zero.  This will not happen when
% the channel numbers are different.  Therefore to make it all work
% together, the following line will check to see if the two channels are
% the same, and reset the lineposition to 0 if they are.  We could have
% ignored the test in favor of always setting the position to 0, but that
% may be inconsistent with the philosophy that all writes update the
% lineposition (however one could argue that the prompt write is special
% and should not update the lineposition).  I'll leave the test in, and
% leave it to future bug reports if this is not what is expected.
