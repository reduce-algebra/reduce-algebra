%  Fixed file name in header.

%  Changed COMPILER-CONSTANT so that in will accept regular constants too.
%  Added LOAD-FOR-COMPILER to load in compiler constants for cross compilation.

%
% The value for a constant is stored the the value cell.  A property is placed
% on the property list (CONSTANT?) to tell the compiler that the value can be
% treated as a constant.
%
% Some constants are implementation specific and need to be handled specially
% by the compiler.  The *CONSTANTS-FOR-COMPILER* flag is set when any constants
% being defined are to be defined for the compiler only.  The values for these
% constants are placed on property lists.
