% Revisions:
%
% 1-Jan-92 (Herbert Melenk)
%  Added findposition and channelfindposition (mostly for REDUCE help system)
% 20-August-90 (Winfried Neun)
%  Changed calls to noniochannelerror to be "never-return", because there is
%  no cure for that and the code is better.
% 27-May-87 (Harold Carr & Leigh Stoller)
%  Changed declaration of in* and out* from global to fluid.
% 31-May-84 10:13:23 (Brian Beach)
%  Changed calls on IDAPPLY1, IDAPPLY2 to use IDAPPLY.
%  Assorted cleanup.
% 01-Dec-83 14:23:04 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
