% Functions flagged IGNORE are evaluated immediately when invoked at the top
% level while compiling to a file.  Those flagged EVAL are evaled immediately
% and also passed to the file.  These functions are defined to make those
% actions more visible and mnemonic.
%

(dm commentoutcode (u)
  nil)

%. Comment out a single expression
(de compiletime (u)
  %. Evaluate at compile time only
  u)

% just return the already evaluated argument
(flag '(commentoutcode . (compiletime)) 'ignore)

% The functions above need only be present at compile time.  Those below must

% be present at both compile and load time to be effective.
(de bothtimes (u)
  %. Evaluate at compile and load time
  u)

(flag '(bothtimes) 'eval)

(de loadtime (u)
  %. Evaluate at load time only
  u)

(remflag '(loadtime) 'ignore)

% just to be sure it doesn't
(remflag '(loadtime) 'eval)

% happen until load time
