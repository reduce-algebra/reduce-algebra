% Revisions:
%
%  Thu Mar  1 21:54:21 1984, Edit by Fish
%    Changed YesP EOF behavior for scripts such as "build".  Normal Unix
%    behavior will now be to exit PSL, returning a non-zero status code
%    to "build", "make", etc.  Logic is included to force a break loop
%    if BreakIn!* = Unix!-TTY!*, just as if a B had been typed to YesP.
% 22-Mar-84 11:23:45 (Brian Beach)
%  Added compiletime load of if-system.
% 26 Jan 1984 0959-PST (Brian Beach)
%  Corrected file name in header.
% 01-Dec-83 14:42:20 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
