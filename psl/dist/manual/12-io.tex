\chapter*{Input and Output}

\section{Introduction}

One category of input and output in LISP is "symbolic" I/O.
This allows a user to print or read possibly complex LISP
objects with one or a few calls on standard functions. PSL also
has powerful general-purpose I/O.

Input from multiple sources and output to multiple destinations
can be done in PSL all  at  the  same  time.  PSL
provides  I/O  functions  with explicit specification of sources
and destinations for I/O.  On the other hand for convenience  it
is often desirable to let the source or destination be implicit.
PSL  provides  the  full set of I/O operations through functions
with an implicit source or destination.

  The functions with and without an explicit channel  designator
argument  are  described together in this chapter.  In each case
calling the function with the implicit source or destination  is
the  same  as calling the version with explicit channel argument
and supplying the value of the  variable  in*  or  out*  as  the
channel.

  The  current input or output channel can be changed by setting
or rebinding the variables {\bf in*}  or {\bf out*}.  
\index{*in}\index{*out}  Historically,  the
functions  rds and wrs have been used for this and they are also
available along with their special features.

\subsection{Organization of this Chapter}

  We first discuss  the  syntax  used  for  symbolic  input  and
output.    The   syntax   described  applies  to  PSL  programs,
interactive typein, format of data in data files, and to  output
by PSL programs except when special formatting is used.

  Functions  for  printing  and  reading  follow.  All (textual)
input and output functions are discussed.   Next  is  open,  for
setting  up input and output with files, plus related functions.
A great deal of user input/output programming can be done  using
just  a  subset  of  the  functions  described  in  these  first
sections.

  PSL includes functions that load program modules  and  execute
command  files.    They  are  essential  to building of software
systems even if the system itself does no  I/O.    Functions  of
this type are described next.

  The  section on I/O channels discusses some features available
for switching the current output from channel  to  channel,  and
documents  some  fluid  variables  used in directing some of the
system's input and output.

  Functions in the next section actually operate on objects such
as lists and strings!  Since I/O functions scan input and format
output, and since it is possible to read  from  or  print  to  a
string, I/O functions can be useful for building strings and for
scanning them.  Some built-in functions are described.

  The  last  two sections describe mechanisms that make possible
some sophisticated uses of the PSL I/O system.    One  describes
the  mechanism in PSL that permits writing to a string or taking
input from the  text  buffer  of  a  text  editor.    The  other
discusses   the  tables  used  by  the  PSL  scanner,  which  is
modifiable.

\section{Printed Representation of LISP Objects}

  Most of this section  is  devoted  to  the  representation  of
tokens.   In addition to tokens there are composite objects with
printed representations: lists and vectors.  We briefly  discuss
their printed formats first.
\begin{verbatim}
"(" expression expression  . . . ")"
"(" expression expression . . . "." expression)
"[" expression expression . . . "]"
\end{verbatim}

  Of  these  the  first  two are for lists.  Where possible, the
first notation is preferred and the  printing  routines  use  it
except  when  the  second  form  is  needed.  The second form is
required when the cdr of a pair is neither nil nor another pair.
The third notation is for vectors.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
(A . (B . C)) % An s-expression
(A B . C)     % Same value, list notation
(A B C)       % An ordinary list
[A B C]       % A vector
\end{verbatim}
  The following standards for representing tokens are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item An id normally consists of uppercase  letters  and  digits.
     The first character can be a digit when the first non-digit
     character  is  a  plus  sign, minus sign, or a letter other
     than "E" or "B".  We exclude lowercase letters because  the
     PSL  reader  will  normally  convert  lowercase  letters to
     uppercase.  Although the user may  use  lowercase  letters,
     the  interpreter  only  sees uppercase.  This conversion is
     controlled by the value of the switch *raise,  a  value  of
     nil  will suppress this conversion.  In addition to letters
     and  numbers,  the  following  characters  are   considered
     alphabetic for the purpose of notating symbols.

\begin{verbatim}
     + - $ & * / : ; | < = > ? ^ _ ~ @
\end{verbatim}
     There is an escape convention for notating an id whose name
     contains  special  characters.    In  addition to lowercase
     letters the following characters are considered special.
\begin{verbatim}
     ! " % ' ( ) . [ ] ` , # |

     JULIE     % three ways to notate the same symbol
     julie
     JuLie
     +$
     1+
     +1        % this is a number, not an id
     x^2+y^2   % a single symbol
\end{verbatim}
\item Strings begin with a  double  quote  (")  and  include  all
     characters  up to a closing  double quote.  A  double quote
     can  be included in  a string by  doubling it.    An  empty
     string,  consisting    of only the  enclosing quote  marks,
     is allowed.   The characters  of  a string are not affected
     by the value of the *raise.  Examples:
\begin{verbatim}
     "This is a string"
     "This is a ""string"""
     ""
\end{verbatim}
\item Integers begin with a digit, optionally preceded by a +  or
     - sign, and consist only of digits.  The global input radix
     is 10; there is no way to change this.  However, numbers of
     different  radices may be read by the following convention.
     A decimal number from 2 to 36 followed by a sharp sign (\#),
     causes the digits (and possibly letters) that follow to  be
     read in the radix of the number preceding the \#. [Footnote:
     Octal  numbers  can  also  be written as a string of digits
     followed by the letter "B".] Thus  63  may  be  entered  as
     8\#77,  or  255  as 16\#ff or 16\#FF.  The output radix can be
     changed, by setting outputbase*.  If outputbase* is not 10,
     the  printed  integer  appears  with   appropriate   radix.
     Leading  zeros are suppressed and a minus sign precedes the
     digits if the integer is negative.  Examples:
\begin{verbatim}
         100
         +5234
         -8#44 (equal to -36)
\end{verbatim}

\item Floats have a period and/or a letter "e" or  "E"  in  them.
     Any of the following are read as floats.  The value appears
     in  the format [-]n.nn...nnE[-]mm  if the magnitude  of the
     number is    too    large  or    small  to    display    in
     [-]nnnn.nnnn    format.      The    crossover    point   is
     determined  by  the implementation.  In BNF,  floats    are
     recognized by the grammar:
\begin{verbatim}
      <base>       ::= <unsigned-integer>.|
                       .<unsigned-integer>|
                       <unsigned-integer>.
                      	<unsigned-integer>
      <ebase>      ::= <base>|<unsigned-integer>
      <unsigned-float> ::= <base>|
                           <ebase>e<unsigned-integer>|
                           <ebase>e-<unsigned-integer>|
                           <ebase>e+<unsigned-integer>|
                           <ebase>E<unsigned-integer>|
                           <ebase>E-<unsigned-integer>|
                           <ebase>E+<unsigned-integer>
      <float>          ::= <unsigned-float>|
                           +<unsigned-float>|
                           -<unsigned-float>
\end{verbatim}
     That is:
\begin{verbatim}
         [+|-][nnn][.]nnn{e|E}[+|-]nnn

         nnn.
         .nnn
         nnn.nnn
\end{verbatim}
     Examples:
\begin{verbatim}
         1e6
         .2
         2.
         2.0
         -1.25E-9
\end{verbatim}

\item Code-pointers  cannot  be read directly, but can be printed
     and   constructed.      Currently   printed    as   
\begin{verbatim}     
    #<Code argument-count hexadecimal-address>.
\end{verbatim}
\item Anything  else is printed as \#$<$Unknown:nnnn$>$, where nnnn is
     the hexadecimal value found in the argument register.  Such
     items are not legal LISP entities  and  may  cause  garbage
     collector  errors  if  they  are  found  in the heap.  They
     cannot be read in.
\end{itemize}

\section{Functions for Printing}

\subsection{Basic Printing}

\de{prin1}{(prin1 ITM:any): ITM:any}{expr}
{}

\de{channelprin1}{(channelprin1 CHAN:io-channel ITM:any): ITM:any}{expr}
{    Channelprin1  is  the  basic   printing   function.      For
    well-formed,  non-circular  structures,  the  result  can be
    parsed by the function read.
}

\de{prin2}{(prin2 ITM:any): ITM:any}{expr}
{}

\de{channelprin2}{(channelprin2 CHAN:io-channel ITM:any): ITM:any}{expr}
{    Channelprin2 is similar to channelprin1, except that strings
    are printed without the  surrounding  double  quotes,    and
    delimiters  within  ids  are  not  preceded  by  the  escape
    character.
}
  
		The following example illustrates the difference between prin1
and prin2.

\begin{verbatim}
ARGUMENT     PRIN1        PRIN2

A!%WORD      A!%WORD      A%WORD
"STRING"     "STRING"     STRING
\end{verbatim}

\de{print}{(print U:any): U:any}{expr}
{}

\de{channelprint}{(channelprint CHAN:io-channel U:any): U:any}{expr}
{    Display U using channelprin1 and  then  terminate  the  line
    using channelterpri.
}
\subsection{Whitespace Printing Functions}

\de{terpri}{(terpri): nil}{expr}
{}

\de{channelterpri}{(channelterpri CHAN:io-channel): nil}{expr}
{    Write  an  end  of line character.  The number of characters
    output on the current line  (that  which  is  referenced  by
    channelposn),  is defined to be zero and the number of lines
    output on the current page  (that  which  is  referenced  by
    channelposn), is incremented.
}

\de{spaces}{(spaces N:integer): nil}{expr}
{}

\de{channelspaces}{(channelspaces CHAN:io-channel N:integer): nil}{expr}
{    N spaces are written.
}

\de{tab}{(tab N:integer): nil}{expr}
{}

\de{channeltab}{(channeltab CHAN:io-channel N:integer): nil}{expr}
{    Move to column N }

{\tt(channelspaces ch (- N (channelposn ch)))}

    If  the position on the current output line is past column N
    then channelterpri is called before moving to column N.

\subsection{Formatted Printing}

\de{printf}{(printf FORMAT:string [ARGS:any]): nil}{expr}
{}

\de{channelprintf}{(channelprintf CHAN:io-channel FORMAT:string [ARGS:any]):nil}{expr}  
{   Channelprintf is a simple routine  for formatted  printing.
    The  FORMAT  is a string.  The characters of this string are
    printed unless a % is encountered.  The character  following
    a  % is interpreted as a formatting directive and is used to
    interpret and print the other  arguments  to  channelprintf.
    The following format characters are currently supported.
}

\begin{tabular}{lp{11.0cm}}
\%b & The next argument is assumed to be an integer, it is passed to spaces.\\
\%c & The next argument should be a single character,
   it is printed by	a call on writechar.\\
\%d & Print the next argument as a decimal integer.\\
\%e & The  next  argument  is evaluated by a call on eval.\\
\%f & Print an end-of-line character if not  
 at  the  beginning  of  the output line 
  (does not use a matching argument).\\
\%l & Print the next argument using print2l, 
this is the same as \%w except that lists
 are  printed without  the  top  level
  pair of parenthesis.
		The empty list is printed as a blank.\\
\%n & Print end-of-line character
	(does  not  use  a matching argument).\\
\%o & Print the next argument as an 
	octal integer.\\
\%p & Print the next argument using prin1.\\
\%p & Print the next argument using prin1.\\
\%r & Print  the  next  argument  using errprin, the
   result  is  the  same  as  \%p  except  that  a
   surrounding pair of quotes are also printed.\\
\%s & The  next  argument is assumed to be a string,
   the surrounding double quotes are not printed.\\
\%t & The next argument is assumed to be an integer,
   it is passed to tab.\\
\%w & Print the next argument using prin2.\\
\%x & Print  the  next  argument  as  a  hexadecimal
   integer.\\
\end{tabular}
    
    If  the character following \% is not either one of the above
    or another \%, it  causes an error.  Thus, to include a \%  in
    the format to be printed, use \%.

    There  is  no checking for correspondence between the number
    of arguments that FORMAT expects and the number given.    If
    the  number  given  is  less  than  the number in the FORMAT
    string, garbage will be inserted for the missing  arguments.
    If the number given is greater than the number in the FORMAT
    string, then the extra ones are ignored.


\de{prettyprint}{(prettyprint U:form): U:form}{expr}
{    Prettyprints U.
}

\subsection{The Fundamental Printing Function}

\de{writechar}{(writechar CH:character): character}{expr}
{}
\de{channelwritechar}{(channelwritechar CHANNEL:io-channel\\ 
CH:character): character}{expr}
{    
    Write one character to the device specified by CHANNEL.  All
    output  is defined in terms of this function.  The number of
    characters  output  on  the  current  line  (that  which  is
    referenced  by  channelposn), and the number of lines output
    on  the  current  page  (that   which   is   referenced   by
    channellposn),  are  updated.   Each  channel  specifies  an
    output function,  it is this function  that  is  applied  to
    CHANNEL and CH to actually write the character.
}

\subsection{Additional Printing Functions}

\de{prin2l}{(prin2l L:any): {L:any, nil}}{expr}
{    Prin2,  except  that a list is printed without the top level
    parentheses.  If L is a pair then the return value  is  nil,
    otherwise the return value will be L.  }

\de{prin2t}{(prin2t X:any): any}{expr}
{}
\de{channelprin2t}{(channelprin2t CHAN:io-channel X:any): any}{expr}
{    Output   X   using  channelprin2  and  terminate  line  with
    channelterpri.
}
\de{princ}{(princ ITM:any): ITM:any}{expr}
{}
\de{channelprinc}{(channelprinc CHAN:io-channel ITM:any): ITM:any}{expr}
{    Same function as channelprin2.
}
\de{errprin}{(errprin U:any): None Returned}{expr}
{    Prin1 with special quotes to highlight U.
}
\de{errorprintf}{(errorprintf FORMAT:string [ARGS:any]): nil}{expr}
{    Errorprintf is similar to  printf, except  that  errout*  is
    used  in  place  of  the  currently selected output channel.
    Channelterpri is called before and  after  printing  if  the
    line position is greater than zero.  }

\de{eject}{(eject): nil}{expr}
{}
\de{channeleject}{(channeleject CHAN:io-channel): nil}{expr}
{    Skip to top of next output page.
}

\subsection{Printing Status and Mode}

  For  information  on directing various kinds of output see the
section on channels.

\variable{outputbase*}{[Initially: 10]} {global}
{    This fluid can be set to control the radix in which integers
    are printed out.  If the radix is not 10, the radix is given
    before a sharp sign.  }
\begin{verbatim}
    1 lisp> 16
    16
    2 lisp> (setq outputbase* 8)
    8#10
    3 lisp> 16
    8#20
\end{verbatim}
\de{posn}{(posn): integer}{expr}
{}

\de{channelposn}{(channelposn CHAN:io-channel): integer}{expr}
{    Returns number of characters output on the current  line  of
    this channel.
}

\de{lposn}{(lposn): integer}{expr}
{}

\de{channellposn}{(channellposn CHAN:io-channel): integer}{expr}
{    Returns number of lines output on this page of this channel.  }

\de{linelength}{(linelength LEN:\{integer, nil\}): integer}{expr}
{}

\de{channellinelength}{(channellinelength CHAN:io-channel
 LEN: \{integer, nil\}): integer}{expr}
{   For  each  channel  there  is a restriction on the length of
    output lines.  If LEN is nil then the value returned will be
    the current maximum length.  If LEN is  an  integer  greater
    than  zero then it will become the new maximum.  However, if
    the argument is zero there will be no  restrictions  on  the
    size of the output lines.  The following example illustrates
    how  this  length  is  used.  PSL uses a similar function to
    apply output functions like prin1.}
\begin{verbatim}
    (de check-line-length (length ch fn token)
      (when (and (> (+ (channelposn ch) length)
                    (channellinelength ch nil))
                 (> (channellinelength ch nil) 0))
        (channelwritechar ch (char eol)))
      (idapply fn (list ch token)))
\end{verbatim}
The fluid variables PrinLevel and PrinLength allow the user to
control how deep the printer will print and how many elements at
a given level the printer  will  print.    This  is  useful  for
objects  which  are  very large or deep.  These variables affect
the functions prin1, prin2, princ, print, and  printf  (and  the
corresponding Channel functions).

\variable{prinlevel}{[Initially: nil]}{global}
{   Controls how many levels deep a nested data object will print. 
  If PrinLevel is nil, then no control is exercised.  Otherwise the
  value should be an integer. An object to be printed is at   
 level 0.  
}

\variable{prinlength}{[Initially: nil]}{global}
{
  Controls how many elements at a given level are printed.   A
  value  of nil indicates that there be no limit to the number
  of components printed.  Otherwise the  value  of  PrinLength
  should be an integer.
}

\section{Functions for Reading}

\subsection{Reading S-Expressions}
\de{read}{(read): any}{expr}

\de{channelread}{(channelread CHAN:io-channel): any}{expr}
{
    Reads  and  returns the next S-expression from input channel
    CHAN.  Valid input forms are: vector-notation, dot-notation,
    list-notation,   numbers,    strings,    and    identifiers.
    Identifiers are interned (see the intern function in Chapter
    4),  unless  the  fluid  variable  *compressing  is non-nil.
    Channelread returns the value of the global  variable \$eof\$
    when  the  end  of  the  currently selected input channel is
    reached.
}
\begin{verbatim}
    (de channelread (ch)
      (let ((currentscantable* lispscantable*)
            (currentreadmacroindicator* 'lispreadmacro))
        (channelreadtokenwithhooks ch)))
\end{verbatim}
    Channelread  uses  the  function  channelreadtokenwithhooks.
    Tokens  are  scanned  within  the  context of the scan table
    bound  to  lispscantable*.   The  scan  table  is  used   to
    recognize  special  character types, for example, delimiters
    like (, ), and space.  The read macro mechanism is  used  to
    parse s-expressions (see section 12.4.5 for more information
    on read macros).  PSL uses a number of read macros which are
    described below.\\

\begin{tabular}{lp{12.0cm}}
    ( &             S-expressions  are  gathered into a list until
                  the matching right parenthesis is read.   Both
                  list  and dot notation are recognized.  A pair
                  or list is returned.\\
    ) &             If a right parenthesis is read and a  matching
                  left  parenthesis had not been previously read
                  then it will be ignored.\\
    $[$ &       S-expressions are gathered into a vector until
                  a matching right bracket is read.  A vector is
                  returned.\\
    '        &      The next  s-expression  read  is  quoted,  the
                  result is of the form (QUOTE S-EXPRESSION).\\
    (char eof) &    If  an  end  of file character is read while a
                  list or vector is being constructed  then  the
                  following error will occur.
                  *****  Unexpected EOF while reading on channel.\\
    `N' &	Otherwise the value of $eof$ is returned.\\
\end{tabular}\\

    The following read macros are defined in the {\tt useful} module.

\begin{tabular}{lp{11.0cm}}
    \#\' &            this is like the quote mark ' but it  is  used
                  for  function  instead  of quote.  For example
                  \#'name reads as (FUNCTION NAME).\\
    \#/ &            this returns the numeric form of the following
                  character  read  without  raising  it.     For
                  example \#/a is 97 while \#/A is 65.\\
    \#$\backslash$ & This  is  a read macro for char (see Chapter 6
                  for more information).  Note that the argument
                  will be raised  if  *raise  is  non-nil.   For
                  example, \#$\backslash$a = \#$\backslash$A = 65.\\
    \#. &            This  causes  the  following  expression to be
                  evaluated at read time.  For  example,  `(1  2
                  \#.(plus 1 2) 4) reads as (1 2 3 4).\\
    \#+ &            The  next  two  expressions  are read.  If the
                  first is a system name which  is  the  current
                  system then the second expression is returned.
                  Otherwise  another  expression  is read and it
                  becomes the value returned.\\
    \#- &            The next two expressions are  read.    If  the
                  first  is  a  system  name  which  is  not the
                  current system then the second  expression  is
                  returned.    Otherwise  another  expression is
                  read and it becomes the value returned.\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Reading Single Characters}

\de{readchar}{(readchar): character}{expr}
{}

\de{channelreadchar}{(channelreadchar CHANNEL:io-channel):
character}{expr} {    
Reads one character (an integer) from CHANNEL. All input is
    defined in terms of this function.  If CHANNEL is  not  open
    or  is  open  for  writing  only, an error is generated.  If
    there is a non-zero value in the  backup  buffer  associated
    with  CHANNEL,  the  buffer is emptied (set to zero) and the
    value returned.  Otherwise, the reading function  associated
    with  CHANNEL  is  called  with CHANNEL as argument, and the
    value it returns is returned by channelreadchar.}
\begin{verbatim}
    ***** Channel not open

\begin{verbatim}
    ***** Channel open for write only
\end{verbatim}
\de{readch}{(readch): id}{expr}
{}

\de{channelreadch}{(channelreadch CHAN:io-channel): id}{expr}
{    Like channelreadchar, but returns the id for  the  character
    rather than its ASCII code.
}

\de{unreadchar}{(unreadchar CH:character): Undefined}{expr}
{}

\de{channelunreadchar}{(channelunreadchar CHAN:io-channel
CH:character): Undefined}{expr}
{   
    The  input  backup  function.  Ch is deposited in the backup
    buffer associated with Chan.  This function should  be  only
    called  after  channelreadchar  is  called,  and  before any
    intervening input operations, since it is used by the  token
    scanner.   The unread buffer only holds one character, so it
    is generally useless to unread more than one character.
}

\subsection{Reading Tokens}

  The functions described here pertain to the token scanner  and
reader.   Globals  and  switches  used  by  these  functions are
defined at the end of this section.

\de{channelreadtoken}{(channelreadtoken CHANNEL:io-channel): 
\{id, number, string\}}{expr}
{    
    This is the basic PSL token scanner.  The value returned  is
    an  item  corresponding  to  the  next  token from the input
    stream.    An  id  will  be  interned  unless   the   switch
    {\bf *compressing}\index{*compressing} is  non-nil. 
    If *compressing is t then the
    print name of the id is passed to  newid,  otherwise  it  is
    passed  to  intern.  
}

 	The global variable toktype* \index{toktype*} is set as
    follows.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
    0 &             if the token is an ordinary id,\\

    1 &            if the token is a string,\\

    2 &             if the token is a number, or\\

    3 &             if the token is an unescaped delimiter such as\\
      &            "(", but not "!(" In this last case, the value\\
      &            returned is the id whose  print  name  is  the\\
      &            same as the delimiter.\\
\end{tabular}

The precise behavior of this function depends on two fluid
variables:

    Currentscantable* is bound to  a  vector  known  as  a  scan
                  table.  Described below. 

    Currentreadmacroindicator* is bound to an id known as a read
                  macro indicator.  Described below.

\de{ratom}{(ratom): \{id, number, string\}}{expr}
{    Reads a token from the current input channel.  }

\de{channelreadtokenwithhooks}{(channelreadtokenwithhooks CHANNEL:io-channel):\\
any}{expr}
{    This   function  reads  a  token  and  performs  any  action
    specified if the token is marked as a read macro  under  the
    current  indicator.   Read  uses  this  function internally.
    Uses the variable  currentreadmacroindicator*
    {\index currentreadmacroindicator*} to  determine
    the current indicator.
}

\subsection{Reading Entire Lines}

\de{readline}{(readline): string}{expr}
{ Same as (channelreadline in*)}
\de{channelreadline}{(channelreadline CHANNEL:io-channel): string}{expr}
{    A  string is returned which contains each character from the
    current position of the scanner to the next  end-of-line  or
    end-of-file character.
}

\subsection{Read Macros}

  At  the  top  level  of  PSL,  an  expression  is  read, it is
evaluated, and then the result is printed.  Normally a macro  is
expanded  during evaluation.  The read macro is a different type
of macro, it is expanded during the reading  phase.    When  the
reader  encounters  a  read  macro  character,  the the macro is
executed and the result is inserted in place of the  read  macro
character.

  A  read  macro  must be a function of two arguments, the first
should represent a IO  channel,  the  second  a  character.    A
character  which  represents  a read macro must be set to one of
two types in the scan table.  It may be either a delimiter or  a
diphthong.    Diphthong  corresponds  to  double  character read
macros, delimiter to single character read macros.  In addition,
the id which corresponds to the  character must have a reference
to the name of the  function  on  its  property  list.    For  a
diphthong  the  indicator must be lispdiphthong, for a delimiter
it must be lispreadmacro.

  The quote macro may be defined  as  follows.    Note  that  we
cannot  use 'form in place of (quote form) until we have defined
the read macro.

\begin{verbatim}
(de doquote (channel ch)
  (list (quote quote) (channelread channel)))
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
(put (quote !') (quote lispreadmacro)(function doquote))
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
(putv lispscantable* (char !') delimiter)
\end{verbatim}
  This says that when a single quote is read, PSL should replace
it with a list consisting of quote and the  next  expression  in
the  input (obtained by an explicit call to channelread).  Since
defining a character as a read macro makes it difficult  to  use
the character in a normal way, read macros should not be letters
or digits.

\subsection{Terminal Interaction}

\de{yesp}{(yesp MESSAGE:string): boolean}{expr}
{    If the user responds y or yes, yesp returns a non-nil value.
    A  response  of  n  or  no results in a value of nil.  It is
    possible to enter a break loop by responding with b.   After
    quitting  the  break loop, one must still respond y, yes, n,
    or no.
}

\subsection{Input Status and Mode}

\variable{promptstring*}{ [Initially: "x lisp$>$"]}{global}
{
    Displayed as a prompt when any  input  is  taken  from  TTY.
    Prompts  should  therefore not be directly printed.  Instead
    the value should be bound to promptstring*.
}

\variable{*eolinstringok}{[Initially: nil]}{switch}
{
    If *eolinstringok is non-nil, the warning message

{\tt *** String continued over end-of-line }\\
    is suppressed.
}

\variable{*raise}{ [Initially: t]}{switch}
{
    If *raise is  non-nil,  all  characters    input  for    ids
    through  PSL input  functions are raised  to upper case.  If
    *raise is nil, characters are input  as is.    A  string  is
    unaffected by *raise.
}

\variable{*compressing}{[Initially: nil] }{switch}
{
    If  *compressing  is  non-nil,  channelreadtoken  and  other
    functions that call it do not intern ids.
}

\variable{currentscantable*}{[Initially: NIL]}{global}
{ This variable is set to lispscantable* by the function read }

\variable{currentreadmacroindicator*}{ [Initially: NIL ]}{global}
{
    The  function  read  binds  this  variable  to   the   value
    LISPREADMACRO.   Its  value  determines  the  property  list
    indicator used in looking up read  macros.    The  user  may
    define  a  set  of  read macros using some new indicator and
    rebind this variable.  Ordinary read macros may be added  by
    putting properties on ids under the LISPREADMACRO indicator.
}

\section{File System Interface: Open and Close}

\de{open}{(open {\small FILENAME:string ACCESSTYPE:id):
CHANNEL:io-channel}}{expr}
{    If  AccessType  is eq to input or output, an attempt is made
    to access  the  system-dependent  FILENAME  for  reading  or
    writing.    If  the  attempt  is  unsuccessful,  an error is
    generated;  otherwise  a  free  channel  is   returned   and
    initialized  to  the  default  conditions  for ordinary file
    input or output.
}
    
				If none of these conditions hold, a file is  not  available,
    or there are no free channels, an error is generated.

\begin{verbatim}
    ***** Unknown access type
    ***** Improperly set-up special IO open call
    ***** File not found
    ***** No free channels
\end{verbatim}
    If  AccessType is eq to SPECIAL, no file is opened.  Instead
    the channel is initialized as  a  generalized  input  and/or
    output stream.  See below.

\de{filep}{(filep NAME:string): boolean}{expr}
{    This  function will return t if file NAME can be opened, and
    nil if not, e.g. if it does not exist.
}

\de{close}{(close CHANNEL:io-channel): io-channel}{expr}
{    The closing function associated with CHANNEL is called, with
    CHANNEL as its argument.  If it is illegal to close CHANNEL,
    if CHANNEL is not open, or if CHANNEL is associated  with  a
    file  and the file cannot be closed by the operating system,
    this function  generates an error.   Otherwise,  CHANNEL  is
    marked as free and is returned.
}

Here  is a simple example of input from a particular file with
output sent to the current output channel.  This function  reads
forms  from  the  file MYFILE.DAT and prints out all those whose
				car is eq to  its  parameter.    Using  unwind-protect,  we  are
				assured  that  the channel (and the file), will be closed in all
				cases, including errors.

\begin{verbatim}
  (de filter-my-file (x)
    (let ((chan (open "MYFILE.DAT" 'input))
          form)
      (unwind-protect
        (while (neq (setq form (channelread chan))
                    $eof$)
               (if (and (pairp form) (eq (car form) x))
                 (print form)))
        (close chan))))
\end{verbatim}

\section{Loading Modules}

Two convenient procedures are available for loading  modules.
Various facilities described  in this manual are actually in
loadable modules and their documentation notes that they must be
loaded.  Loadable modules typically exist as FASL files .B
files see the section on the compiler for information on
producing FASL files.

\de{load}{(load [FILE:\{string, id\}]): nil}{macro}
{    For each argument FILE, an  attempt  is  made  to  locate  a
    corresponding  file.   If  a  file  is found then it will be
    loaded by a call on an appropriate function.   A  full  file
    name is constructed by using the directory specifications in
    loaddirectories* and the extensions in loadextensions*.  The
    strings  from  each  list are used in a left to right order,
    for a given string from loaddirectories* each extension from
    loadextensions*   is   used.  More   information   about
    loaddirectories* and loadextensions* can be found below.
}

While the file is being loaded *usermode will be set to nil.
If a file cannot be found the call on load will be aborted.

\begin{verbatim}
    ***** `FILE' load module not found
\end{verbatim}
    If either *verboseload or *printloadnames is non-nil then
    \index{*verboseload}\index{*printloadnames}

\begin{verbatim}
    *** loading FULL-NAME
\end{verbatim}
    is  printed just prior to loading the file.  Once a file has
    been loaded the message

\begin{verbatim}
    *** FILE loaded
\end{verbatim}
    will  be  printed  if  the  *verboseload  is  non-nil.    In
    addition,  the  name FILE is added to the list referenced by
    options*.  If an attempt is made to load a  file  which  has
    been partially loaded then

\begin{verbatim}
  *** Warning: Load of FILE previously requested, but incomplete.
\end{verbatim}
    will be printed.  If FILE is found to be  in  options*  then
    the attempt to load FILE will be ignored.

\begin{verbatim}
    *** FILE already loaded
\end{verbatim}
    Note  that memq is used to determine if FILE is in options*.
    Therefore when you use string arguments for  loading  files,
    although  identical  names for ids refer to the same object,
    identical names for strings refer to different objects.


\de{reload}{(reload [FILE:\{string,id\}]): nil}{macro}
{    Reload is very similar to load. The difference  between  the
    two  is that for each name FILE, the first occurance of FILE
    in options* will be removed before attempting  to  load  the
    file.
}

\de{imports}{(imports FILES:list): nil}{expr}
{    This  function  is also used to load modules.  If imports is
    invoked as another module is being loaded, then the  modules
    specified  by  FILES will not be loaded until the loading of
    the current  module  is  complete.    Otherwise  imports  is
    identical to load.
}

\variable{loaddirectories* }{[Initially: list]}{global}
{ References  a list of strings to append to the front of
file names passed as arguments to load, reload, and imports. }

\variable{loadextensions*}{[Initially: association-list]}{global}
{
   References the a-list {\tt ((".b" . faslin) (".lap" . lapin)) }    
				
The car of  each  pair  is  a  string  which  represents  an
extension  to  append to the end of the file names passed as
arguments to load, reload,  and  imports.    The  cdr  is  a
function  appropriate  for  loading  a  file of a particular
extension.  For example, a file  whose  extension  is  B  is
loaded with the function faslin.  }

\variable{options*}{[Initially: nil]}{global}
{
    Once  a  file  corresponding  to  an argument FILE to either
    load, reload, or imports has been loaded, FILE will be added
    to the list referenced by options*.  An attempt  to  load  a
    file  by applying load or imports will be aborted if FILE is
    found in options*.  Reload removes the  first  occurance  of
    FILE from options* before passing its argument to load.
}

\variable{*verboseload}{[Initially: nil]}{switch}
{
    If non-nil, a message is displayed when a request is made to
    load  a  file  which has already been loaded, when a file is
    about to be loaded, and  when  the  loading  of  a  file  is
    complete.      Since  *redefmsg  is  set  to  the  value  of
    *verboseload, a non-nil value  will also cause a message  to
    be printed whenever a function is redefined during a load.
}

\variable{*printloadnames}{[Initially: nil]}{switch}
{
    If  non-nil, a message is printed when a file is about to be
    loaded.
}

\section{Reading Files into PSL}

The following procedures are used to read complete files  into
PSL,  by  first calling open, and then processing each top level
form in the file.  The effect is similar to what would happen if
the file were typed into PSL.  File  names  are  represented  by
strings.    File  names may be given using full system dependent
file name conventions.

\variable{*echo}{[Initially: nil]}{switch}
{
    The switch echo is used to control  the  echoing  of  input.
    When  (on  echo) is placed in an input file, the contents of
    the file are echoed on the standard output  device.    Dskin
    does not change the value of *echo, so one may say (on echo)
    before calling dskin, and the input will be echoed.
}

\de{dskin}{(dskin NAME:string): {nil, abort}}{expr}
{    The contents of the file are processed as if they were typed
    in.    If  the  processing of the file is aborted the return
    value will be the identifier abort and the  following  error
    message will be printed.
}

{\tt   ***** DSKIN of `NAME' aborted after N form(s) }\\

A  count  of  each  top  level  form  is  kept  as  they are
processed, which is the value N in the error message.   Once
in*  has been bound to the channel which represents the open
file, each form is processed by a function  similar  to  the
one below.

\begin{verbatim}
  (de dskin-step ()
    (let ((form (funcall toploopread*)))
      (cond ((eq form $eof$) 'eof)
            ((not *defn)
             (funcall toploopprint* (funcall toploopeval* form))
            (dfprint* (funcall dfprint* form))
            (t (prettyprint form)))))
\end{verbatim}
    
Note  that  the  functions  used for reading, evaluating and
    printing are the same as those used in toploop (see  Chapter
    15  for more information).  If dfprint* has a value (and the
    switch *defn is non-nil), then it will  be  applied  to  the
    expression  instead  of  applying  the  functions  bound  to
    toploopeval* and toploopprint*.  If dfprint* does not have a
    value (and the switch *defn is  nil),  then  the  expression
    will be simply be printed by a call on prettyprint.

    Dskin  is  flagged  ignore.   This means that when a file is
    compiled, a top level application of dskin will be evaluated
    but not compiled.   For  more  information  about  the  flag
    ignore see Chapter 19.

\de{lapin}{(lapin NAME:string): \{nil, abort\}}{expr}
{    Almost  identical  to  dskin. The  difference is that the
    function bound to toploopprint* is not applied.  In general,
    this means that the results of evaluation are not printed.
}

    Note that lapin is not flagged ignore as is dskin. This
    means  that a top level application of lapin is compiled but
    not evaluated.  For more information on how the flags ignore
    and eval effect compilation see Chapter 19.

\de{faslin}{(faslin FILENAME:string): nil}{expr}
{    This is an efficient binary read loop, which fetches blocks
    of  code,  constants  and  compactly  stored ids. It uses a
    bit-table to relocate code and to identify special
    LISP-oriented constructs.  FILENAME must be a complete file
    name.
}

\section{About I/O Channels}

\de{rds}{(rds {CHANNEL:io-channel, nil}): io-channel}{expr}
{    Rds sets in* to the value of its argument, and  returns  the
    previous value of in*.  In addition, if specialrdsaction* is
    non-nil,  it  should  be a function of 2 arguments, which is
    called with the old channel as its first  argument  and  the
    new channel as its second argument.  (rds nil) does the same
    as (rds stdin*).
}

\de{wrs}{(wrs {CHANNEL:io-channel, nil}): io-channel}{expr}
{    Wrs  sets  out* to the value of its argument and returns the
    previous value of out*.  In addition,  if  specialwrsaction*
    is non-nil, it should be a function of 2 arguments, which is
    called  with  the  old channel as its first argument and the
    new channel as its second argument.  (wrs nil) does the same
    as (wrs stdout*).
}
  Global variables containing  information  about  channels  are
listed below.

\variable{in*}{[Initially: 0]}{global}
{
    Contains  the  currently selected input channel.  May be set
    or rebound by the user.  This is  changed  by  the  function
    rds.
}

\variable{out*}{[Initially: 1]}{global}
{
    Contains  the currently selected output channel.  May be set
    or rebound by the user.  This is  changed  by  the  function
    wrs.
}

\variable{stdin*}{ [Initially: 0]}{global}
{
    The  standard  input  channel  (but not in the Unix sense of
    standard input).  Channel 0 is ordinarily the  terminal  and
    this variable is not intended to be set or rebound.
}

\variable{stdout*}{[Initially: 1]}{global}
{
    The  standard  output channel.  Like channel 0, channel 1 is
    ordinarily always the terminal, and  this  variable  is  not
    intended to be set or rebound.
}

\variable{breakin*}{[Initially: nil]}{global}
{
    The  channel  from  which the break loop gets its input.  It
    has been set to default  to  stdin*,  but  may  have  to  be
    changed on some systems with buffered-IO.
}

\variable{breakout*}{[Initially: nil]}{global}
{
    The  channel  to  which the break loop sends its output.  It
    has been set to default to  stdout*,  but  may  have  to  be
    changed on some systems with buffered-IO.
}

\variable{errout*}{[Initially: 1]}{global}
{
    The channel used by the errorprintf.
}

\variable{specialrdsaction*}{[Initially: nil]}{global}{}

\variable{specialwrsaction*}{[Initially: nil]}{global}{}

\section{I/O to and from Lists and Strings}

\de{bldmsg}{(bldmsg FORMAT:string, [ARGS:any]): string}{expr}
{    Printf to string.  This can be used as a very convenient way
    of  obtaining  the  printed  representation of an object for
    further  analysis.   In  many  cases  it  is  also  a   very
    convenient  way  of  constructing a needed string.  An error
    will occur on overflow.  Overflow occurs when the length  of
    the result exceeds the value of maxtokensize.
}
\begin{verbatim}
***** Buffer overflow while constructing error message: FORMAT
\end{verbatim}
\de{flatsize}{(flatsize U:any): integer}{expr}
{    Character length of prin1 S-expression.  }

\de{flatsize2}{(flatsize2 U:any): integer}{expr}
{    Prin2 version of flatsize.  }

\de{explode}{(explode U:any): id-list}{expr}
{    Explode takes the constituent characters of an  S-expression
    and forms a list of single character ids.  It is implemented
    via  the  function  channelprin1,  with a list rather than a
    file or terminal as destination.   Returned  is  a  list  of
    interned  characters representing the characters required to
    print the value of U.
}
\begin{verbatim}
    1 lisp> (explode 'foo)
    (f O O)
    2 lisp> (explode '(a . b))
    (!( a !  !. !  b !))
\end{verbatim}

\de{explode2}{(explode2 U:{atom}-{vector}): id-list}{expr}
{    Prin2 version of explode.  }

\de{compress}{(compress U:id-list): {atom}-{vector}}{expr}
{    U is a list of single character identifiers which  is  built
    into  a PSL  entity and returned.   Recognized are  numbers,
    strings,  and  identifiers  with    the   escape   character
    prefixing    special characters.  The formats of these items
    appear in the "Primitive Data Types" Section, Section 2.1.2.
    Identifiers are not interned on the id-hash-table.  Function
    pointers may not be compressed.   If  an  entity  cannot  be
    parsed out of U or characters are left over after parsing an
    error occurs: }
\begin{verbatim}
    ***** Poorly formed atom in COMPRESS
\end{verbatim}
\de{implode}{(implode U:id-list): atom}{expr}
{    Compress with ids interned.
}

\section{Generalized Input/Output Streams}

  All  input  and  output  functions are implemented in terms of
operations on "channels".  A channel is  just  a  small  integer
\footnote{ The   range   of  channel  numbers  is  from  0  to
MaxChannels, where MaxChannels is a  system-dependent  constant,
currently  31,  defined  in  the module {\bf io-decls}} which has 3
functions and some other information associated with  it.    The
three functions are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item   A  reading  function,  which is called with the channel as
     its argument and returns the integer  ASCII  value  of  the
     next  character of the input stream.  If the channel is for
     writing only, this function is writeonlychannel.    If  the
     channel   has   not   been   opened,   this   function   is
     channelnotopen.  The reading function  is  responsible  for
     echoing characters if the flag *echo is non-nil.  It should
     use  the  function writechar to echo the character.  It may
     not be appropriate for a read function to echo  characters.
     For  example,  the  "disk"  reading  function does echoing,
     while the reader used to implement  the  compress  function
     does not.

The  read function must also be concerned with the
handling of ends of "files" (actually, ends of 
channels) and ends of lines.  It should return the
ASCII code for an end of  file character (system
dependent) when reaching the end of a channel. It
should return the ASCII code for a line  feed 
character  to indicate an end of line (or "newline").
This may require that the ASCII code for carriage
return  be ignored when read, not returned.
 
\item A writing function, which is called with the channel as its
first argument and the integer ASCII value of the
character to  write  as  its  second argument.  If
the channel is for reading only, this function is
readonlychannel. If the channel has not been
opened, this function is channelnotopen.

  
\item	A closing function, which is called with the channel as its
argument and performs any action necessary for the 
graceful termination of input and/or output operations 
to that channel. If the channel is not open, this 
function is channelnotopen.
\end{enumerate}

  The other information associated with a channel  includes  the
current  position in the output line (used by posn), the maximum
line  length  allowed  (used  by  linelength  and  the  printing
functions),  the  single  character input backup buffer (used by
the token scanner), and other system-dependent information.

  Ordinarily, the user need not be aware  of  the  existence  of
this  mechanism. However,  because  of  its generality, it is
possible to implement operations other than  just  reading  from
and  writing  to  files  using  it. In  particular,  the LISP
functions explode and compress are performed  by  writing  to  a
list  and reading from a list, respectively (on channels 3 and 4
respectively).

\subsection{Using the "Special" Form of Open}

  If Open is called with AccessType eq to SPECIAL and the global
variables   specialreadfunction*,   specialwritefunction*,   and
specialclosefunction*  are  bound to ids, then a free channel is
returned and its associated functions are set to the  values  of
these  variables.    Other non system-dependent status is set to
default  conditions,  which  can  later  be  overridden.     The
functions  readonlychannel and writeonlychannel are available as

occurs.

\section{Scan Table Internals}
		
The  scan  table controls the behaviour of the reader.  It can
be modified to extend the syntax of PSL or to aid the writing of
other parsers.  This table contains information about the syntax
of each character.   It  is  possible  to  have  several  tables
describing  different syntaxes and to switch from one to another
by binding the variable lispscantable*.

	The table is a vector of 129 entries,  indexed  by  0  through
128.   The first 128 entries correspond to ASCII character code.
Each entry contains an integer between 0 and 21. The meaning  of
these numbers is given below.

\begin{tabular}{lp{13.0cm}}
0 \ldots 9 & DIGIT: indicates the character is a digit  and gives the 
                   	corresponding numeric value.\\
10 &       LETTER: indicates the character is alphabetic.\\
11 &       DELIMITER: indicates the character is a delimiter, the first
                    character of a diphthong should not be classified as
                    a delimiter.\\
12 &       COMMENT: indicates the character begins a comment, terminated
                  by an end of line.\\
13 &       DIPHTHONG: indicates the character is a delimiter which may be
																						the
                    starting character of a diphthong.  A diphthong is a
                    two character sequence read as one token.\\
14 &       IDESCAPE: indicates that the character is an escape character, this
                   character is used within id names to reference a character
                   which is not a digit or alphabetic.\\
15 &       STRINGQUOTE: indicates that the character is used to delimit strings.\\
16 &       PACKAGE: indicates that the character is used to introduce explicit
                  package names.\\
17 &       IGNORE: indicates that the character is to be ignored.\\
18 &       MINUS: indicates that the character represents a minus sign.\\
19 &       PLUS: indicates that the character represents a plus sign.\\
20 &       DECIMAL: indicates that the character represents a decimal point.\\
21 &       IDSURROUND: indicates that the character is to act for identifiers
                     as a string quote for strings.\\
%\end{TABELLE***}
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}
It  may  be  tedious to insert an idescape character (!), before
every delimiter character in the name of an id.  By setting  the
type  of  a character (for example |), to idsurround this can be
avoided.  Every character between the vertical bars is taken  as
part  of  the  ids name, as if ! were written before each.  Note
that !! corresponds to ! and !| to |.
% establish | as the character to surround the name of ids
\begin{verbatim}
  (PUTV LISPSCANTABLE* (CHAR '|) IDSURROUND)

|"|     % the same as !"
|dave|  % the name of the id is dave not DAVE
|!|!!|  % the name is |!, the same effect is gotten
        % by writing !|!!
\end{verbatim}
\variable{lispscantable*}{[Initially: as described below]}{global}
{
    Lispscantable* associates a type with each character.  It is
    a vector of 129 entries.  The type  for  a  character  C  is
    stored  at  index  (CHAR  C).    The  table below lists each
    character under its type.  The 128'th entry is the diphthong
    indicator, LISPDIPHTHONG.
}

\begin{verbatim}
    DIGIT        0 through 9
    LETTER       a through z, A through Z, #, $, &, *, /,
                 @, ;, :, <, >, =, ^, _, {, }, |, ~, ?,
                 ^A through ^H, ^K, ^N through ^Y, ^\,^],
                 ^^, ^_, rubout
    DELIMITER    (, ), ', `, ^Z, [, ]
    COMMENT      %
    DIPHTHONG    ,
    IDESCAPE     !
    STRINGQUOTE  "
    PACKAGE      \
    IGNORE       null, tab, line-feed, ^L,
                 carriage-return	and space

\section{Scan Table Utility Functions}

The following functions are provided to manage scan tables, in
the {\bf read-utils} module.

\de{printscantable}{(printscantable TABLE:vector): nil}{expr}
{    Prints the entire scantable,  gives  the  0 ... 127  entries
    with  the  name  of  the  character  class.  Also prints the
    indicator used for diphthongs.
}

\de{copyscantable}{(copyscantable OLDTABLE:\{vector, nil\}): vector}{expr}
{    Copies the existing scantable (or currentscantable* if given
    nil).  The 128'th entry (the diphthong  indicator),  of  the
    copy is set to the result of a call on gensym.
}

\de{putdiphthong}{(putdiphthong TABLE:vector D1:id ID2:id DIP:id): nil}{expr}
{    Installs  DIP  as  the name of the diphthong Id1 followed by
    ID2 in the given scan table.
}

\section{Binary I/O Functions}

Binary input and output are necessary to provide an efficient access to
large files e.g. for loading or generating binary files (e.g. faslin
or faslout) or for
communication with other
processors e.g. graphics or database processors.
Another important application is the connection between two or more
PSL processors on incompatible platforms.
In the following descriptions HANDLE means something system specific
which in many cases should better not be interpreted by the LISP
evaluator. One can very well think of HANDLE as a FILE* object
belonging to the world of C's I/O library.
The results of a binary read function is usually not
meant for LISP evaluation, either.

\de{binaryopenread}{(binaryopenread FILENAME:string): HANDLE}{expr}
{opens the file FILENAME for reading. If the file cannot be opened,
an error message {\tt Couldn't open binary file for input} will be shown,
an error condition is raised.}

\de{binaryopenwrite}{(binaryopenwrite FILENAME:string): HANDLE}{expr}
{opens the file FILENAME for writing. If the file cannot be opened,
an error message {\tt Couldn't open binary file for output} will be shown,
an error condition is raised.}

\de{binaryopenappend}{(binaryopenappend FILENAME:string): HANDLE}{expr}
{opens the file FILENAME in append mode. If the file cannot be opened,
an error message {\tt Couldn't open binary file for append} will be shown,
an error condition is raised.}

\de{binaryopenupdate}{(binaryopenupdate FILENAME:string): HANDLE}{expr}
{opens the file FILENAME for update. If the file cannot be opened,
an error message {\tt Couldn't open binary file for update} will be shown,
an error condition is raised.}

\de{binaryclose}{(binaryclose Filepointer:handle):NIL}{expr}
{Closes the file referenced by filepointer}

\de{binaryread}{(binaryread CHANNEL:handle): any}{expr}
{reads one LISP item from file channel and returns it as value. There is
no way to distinguish error conditions from normal return values.}

\de{binaryreadblock}{(binaryreadblock CHANNEL:handle ADDR:int SIZE:int): int}
{expr}
{reads SIZE LISP items from the file into an array pointed to by ADDR.
The number of actually read items is returned,
indicating error or end-of-file if the returned
value is less than the number of items requested.}

\de{binarywrite}{(binarywrite CHANNEL:handle WORD:any): NIL}{expr}
{writes one LISP item in WORD to file channel.}

\de{binarywriteblock}{(binarywriteblock Filepointer:handle ADDR:int SIZE:int):
NIL}
{expr}
{writes SIZE LISP items from the an array pointed to by ADDR to the file
referenced by Filepointer.
The number of actually written items is returned,
indicating error if the returned value is less than the number of
items requested.}

\de{binarypositionfile}{(binarypositionfile CHANNEL:handle, SPECIAL:int): any}{expr}
{this corresponds to C's fseek operation. The special value (the address)
as well as the
return value is system dependent, please investigate.}
