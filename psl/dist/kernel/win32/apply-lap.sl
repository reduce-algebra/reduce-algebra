% Revisions:
%
% 22-Mar-84 08:32:58 (Brian Beach)
%  Commented out ADDRESSAPPLY0, since it is in the kernel.
% 02-Mar-84 09:29:05 (Jim Ambras/CRC)
%  Corrected file header.
% 06-Jan-84 15:34:49 (Tim Tillson)
%  Un-rlisp'ed Sam's D-register model version.  This file plus PHP:LAP.SL,
%  replaces php:apply-lap.sl.  For other machines besides HP9836 PWS, this
%  file would need an appropriate machine-dependent section (like php:lap.sl).
