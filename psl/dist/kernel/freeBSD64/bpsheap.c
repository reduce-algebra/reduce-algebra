%
% Revisions:
%
% 11-Aug-88 (Julian Padget)
%  Added initialization of bpslowerbound in setupbps().
% 07-Apr-87 (Harold Carr & Leigh Stoller)
%  Put in error checking to ensure that the memory pointers will fit in
%   info field of the lisp item.
% 21-Dec-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added allocatemorebps function, called from try-other-bps-spaces in
%   allocators.sl.
% 18-Dec-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Changed to newer model. Bps is now defined in bps.c so that unexec can
%  alter the text/data boundry. Took out code that allowed command line
%  modification of bpssize. (Now set in the Makefile). Added setupbps()
%  that initialzes nextbps and lastbps.
% 20-Sep-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Removed assembler alias statements because they are not portable. Instead,
%  a sed script will be used to convert the _variables of C to VARIABLES of
%  PSL.
