% Revisions:
%
% 20-Jun-89 (Winfried Neun)
%  added reference to symget vector as internal structure
% 31-Aug-88 (Julian Padget)
%  Changed fluids to globals, since latter needed in CPSL.
% 28-Oct-87 (Harold Carr)
%  Made panic exit call exit-with-status, rather than redundantely doing
%  what panic exit already did then calling external_exit.
% 13-Apr-87 (Harold Carr & Leigh Stoller)
%  Added external fluid _infbitlength_ to be used in bpsheap.c.
% 26-Sep-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Changed exit to unix to be a call to exit library function. The Sun does
%  accept the exit status in (reg 1) like the Bobcat. Called it external_exit
%  so it does not interfere with the cmacro of the same name.
% 22-Sep-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Commented out calls 68020_advise which is not defined on the sun.
% 18-Jul-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Changed the allocation of argumentblock to be the number of maxregs since
%   it is indexed by base + reg number.
% 15-Feb-85 13:27:53 ()
%  Made it so that PSL allocates the stack it will use.
%  Removed TST.B for stack expansion.
%  Included declaration of STACKSIZE (should go in SYS-CONSTS eventually).
% 9-Jul-84 09:11:55 (RAM)
%  Added fluids (and initialization) unixstdin, unixstdout, unixstderr,
%  unixnull, unixeof, unixtty.
% 3-Jul-84 10:51:27 (RAM)
%  Changed name of initial faslin file to $pnkl/load-psl.b since
%  binaryopenread can now expand shell variable references.
% 29-Jun-84 12:33:38 (RAM)
%  Chagged exit_to_unix to exit-to-unix to match call in kernel-fatal-error.
%  Removed save and restore of A6.
% 31-May-84 08:15:32 (Brian Beach)
%  Changed SYSCLEARIO call to HP_CLEARIO.  SYSCLEARIO is now called by the 
%  loader as part of its startup.
