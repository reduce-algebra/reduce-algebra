% Special values for labelling unoccupied slots:
%
(define-constant hash-table-size     1001003)
(define-constant maxsymbols          1000000)


(define-constant deleted-slot-value  16#ffffffff)
(define-constant empty-slot-value    0)

%
% Predicates for unoccupied slots:
%

(ds deleted-slot? (u)
  (weq (hash-table-entry u) deleted-slot-value))

(ds empty-slot? (u)
  (weq (hash-table-entry u) empty-slot-value))
