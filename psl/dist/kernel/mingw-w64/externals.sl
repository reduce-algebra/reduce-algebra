% Revisions:
%
% 17-Feb-89 (Chris Burdorf)
% Changed name of sigset to sun3_sigset for sun os/4.
% 05-Apr-88 (Julian Padget)
%  Once more reinstated handle for alarm and ualarm.
% 29-May-87 (Harold Carr & Leigh Stoller)
%  Added external definition for setenv.
% 05-May-87 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added external definitions for fast-math.sl. They are in float.c
% 13-Apr-87 (Leigh Stoller & Harold Carr)
%  Added external definition of allocatemorebps, defined in bpsheap.c.
% 26-Sep-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added external entry for exit which is needed on the sun to pass an exit
%  code back to unix.
% 01-Sep-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added external-system to do a standard system call from C.
% 19-Aug-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Added entries for get_file_status, sigrelse, and sigset.
% 15-Feb-85 13:25:18 (Brian Beach)
%  Commented out a couple of functions for Pisces.
% 01-Feb-85 (Bill Williams)
%  Add external entries for Lisp terminal emulator.
% 24-Jan-85 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Added sleep entry.
% 7-Jan-85 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Removed nmodekeys entry.
% 17-Dec-84 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Added setlinebuf entry.
%  Added syscall entry, for access to HP-UX system calls.  The syntax
%  of this command is (syscall <system call #> <arg1> <arg2> ...).
%  Currently, a limit of four arguments to the system call is imposed,
%  since no system calls that we can use have more than this.  The
%  various forms of execl do, but since we can't use fork now, we don't
%  need this.  When we can use fork, the number of arguments allowed
%  by syscall should be increased.
% 7-Dec-84 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Added nmodekeys entry, so 9836-users can call it.
% 27-Sep-84 19:57:38 (Dave Matthews)
%  Added an external function declaration for the new alterheapsize function.
% 17-Jul-84 22:51:12 (RAM)
%  Changed chdir to unixcd and time to external_time.
%  Added external_stat, link, and unlink.

%% See $pxnk/sys-io.sl for the call to this. In SYS V, it may have to be
%% moved into the microkernel since it is not directly supported. Under
%% SYS V, buffering can only be changed before any writes on the stream,
%% which means it must be called before setupbpsandheap. Also, under BSD,
%% setlinebuf is a system call, while under SYS V, it must be written using
%% setbuf and setvbuf. See the Bobcat version of setlinebuf.c in $pb.
