% Revisions:
%
% 1-Nov-90  (Winfried Neun)
%  Initial version for IBM RS 6000
% 14-Jun-88 (Tsuyoshi Yamamoto)
%  Added new relocation types (relocate-movex,relocate-call) and long word
%  alignment for halfword access.
% 10-Jan-84 (Brian Beach)
%  Commented-in checking of fasl-magic-number.
% 13-Nov-84 14:13:11 (Brian Beach)
%  Moved FASLIN-INTERN to INTERN.SL.
% 10-May-84 14:35:05 (Brian Beach)
%  Changed fasl-magic-number to faslin-magic (which is defined now in SYS-CONSTS.)
% 01-Dec-83 14:44:33 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
