% Revisions:
%
% 15-Sep-88 (T. Yamamoto and C. Burdorf)
%  Moved collect out of expand_file_name so it won't be overwritten as a
%  local before it is referenced.
% 20-Sep-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Removed assembler alias statements because they are not portable. Instead,
%  a sed script will be used to convert the _variables of C to VARIABLES of
%  PSL.
% 17-Jul-84 22:48:32 (RAM)
%  Added unixcd, a routine that calls expand_file_name before calling chdir.
% 3-Jul-84 10:45:57 (RAM)
%  Added expand_file_name (called from unixopen) to expand shell variable
%  references and ~ home directory syntax.
% 29-Jun-84 14:21:21 (RAM)
%  Added unixputs and unixopen.
% 21-May-84 17:41:41 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Added unixcleario.  It is called by syscleario.

/* The function expand_file_name is used to expand shell variable references
   and ~ notation for directories in file names before calling fopen.
   This eliminates the need for the HPUX-PATH and VAX-PATH kludges that were
   once required, however, such a mechanism may still be used to override the
   values supplied by the shell environment.  The file name is first copied
   to a temporary copy because the parsing algorithm must write into the
   string (this may change).  For now, the maximum string length supported
   is 255 characters, but no checking is done to see if this is exceeded.
   $ and ~ variables are expanded in one pass by calling the functions getenv,
   getuid, getpwuid, and getpwnam.  If any expansion fails, the original
   string is returned.
