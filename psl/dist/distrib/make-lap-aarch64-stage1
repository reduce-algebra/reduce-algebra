%% For machines that require the carcdr.sl fix for car/cdr of NIL, make sure
%% we turn on fastcar to ensure optimized code. Since PSL was written with
%% the assumption that car/car of NIL was illegal, it is not necessary
%% to generate code to test for this, slowing down all car/cdr operations
%% in the process. For user code though, it defaults to off for safety.
