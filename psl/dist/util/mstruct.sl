%
% DESCRIPTION
%
%	(defstruct <structspec> [ <slotspec>... ] )
%
%	The <structspec> may be either the name of the structure, or a 
%	list containing the name followed by zero or more options.
%	Each <slotspec> may be either a list containing the slot name 
%	and its default value, or simply the slot name, in which case 
%	the default value is NIL.
%
%	Each option in the <structspec> may be either an option name, 
%	or a list containing the option name and a specified value.
%	If only the option name is given, then the default value for 
%	the given option is used.  If NIL is the specified value in 
%	an option, then the option is not used at all (in general a NIL
%	value is the same as not having that option in the list at all).
%	If the same option appears more than once with different values, 
%	the last one in the <structspec> takes precedence.
%
%	These are the valid options:
%
%	SLOT-PREFIX or PREFIX or CONC-NAME
%		Append a prefix to each slot accessor macro.  The 
%		default prefix is the structure name and a hyphen.  
%		The symbol CONC-NAME is accepted for backwards 
%		compatability, dispite the fact that it isn't a 
%		particularly descriptive term.
%
%	PREDICATE
%		Makes the zeroth element of the structure contain 
%		the structure name, and creates a predicate macro 
%		to test if a given item is an instance of this 
%		structure.  The specified value is the name of 
%		the predicate macro.  The default value is the 
%		structure name followed by a `P'.
%
%	CONSTRUCTOR
%		By default the name of the constructor macro is 
%		`MAKE-' followed by the structure name.  You may 
%		provide a different constructor name with this 
%		option.  If there is no constructor option in the 
%		<structspec> the default constructor will still 
%		be generated.  The only way to completely sup-
%		press the generation of a constructor macro is to 
%		have a (CONSTRUCTOR NIL) option.
%
%	The flag !*FAST-STRUCTS controls how the accessor macros expand.  
%	If it is NIL, they expand as GETVs, otherwise they expand as 
%	IGETVs.

%
% REVISION HISTORY
%	07/19/85 BAF -- File created.
%	01/26/89 BAF -- Added predicate and constructor macros so that 
%			this code can replace the RLISP record code. 
%			Changed  GetR to StructFetch, and !*FAST-RECORDS 
%			to !*FAST-STRUCTS.  Added code to check the 
%			validity of the options.  Also added this file 
%			header.
%	01/30/89 BAF -- Added CONC-NAME as a synonym for SLOT-PREFIX and 
%			the ExplodeId function for compatability with 
%			existing programs (eg. ernie).
