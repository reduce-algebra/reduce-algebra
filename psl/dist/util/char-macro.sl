% Revisions:
%
% 6 May 1984 1607-PDT (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Changed file name, since moved out of kernel.  Added compiletime loads
%  to allow separate compilation in useful package.  Changed #\!0 to 48,
%  since #\ not yet available.
% 27 Jan 1984 0914-PST (Brian Beach)
%  Corrected file name in header.
% 20 Dec 1983 1706-PST (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Added header.
% 1 Feb 1983 1355-PST  (Cris Perdue)
%  pk:char.red merged with the version in USEFUL.  Some symbolic names
%  for characters removed (not needed, I hope).
