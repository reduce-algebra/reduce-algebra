% Revisions:
%
% 03-Sep-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Commented out 68000 version of char-search2. 
% 12 Apr 1984 1423-PST (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Changed if_system HP9836 to MC6800, since we believe it should work on all
%  68000 -- at least HP9836 and HPUX200.
% 02-Mar-84 09:36:22 (Jim Ambras/CRC)
%  Corrected file header.
% 09-Jan-84 15:01:26 (Tim Tillson)
%   Modified LAP for D-register version
% 03-Aug-83 17:16:52, Cris Perdue
%   Changed names from upper to fast-char-upcase and lower to
%   fast-char-downcase.
% 01-Aug-83 17:53:20, Cris Perdue
%   Added definition of fast-char-lessp.
% 28-Jul-83 Nancy Kendzierski
%   Changed use of autoincrement to postincrement to conform to new
%   code generation.
% 26 Jul 1983 1532-PDT, Cris Perdue
%   Corrected bugs in string-search-from-equal, improved
%   performance a little.
% 19-Jul-83 15:05:43, Cris Perdue
%   Corrected name from substring-= to substring=.
%   Changed args to substring-equal and substring=.
% 02-Jun-83 18:11:27, Cris Perdue
%   Added string-search-equal, string-search-from-equal, substring-=,
%   and substring-equal.

%%% General-purpose searches for substring.  Case is important.
%%% If the target is found, the index in the domain of the
%%% leftmost character of the leftmost match is returned,
%%% otherwise NIL.
%%%
%%% (STRING-SEARCH TARGET DOMAIN).
%%% If passed two strings, Common LISP "search" will give the
%%% same results.
%%%
%%% (STRING-SEARCH-FROM TARGET DOMAIN START)
%%% Like string-search, but the search effectively starts at index
%%% START in the domain.
%%% 
%%% (STRING-SEARCH-EQUAL TARGET DOMAIN)
%%% Like string-search except that the comparisons are case-insensitive.
%%% string-search-equal and string-search-from-equal have been implemented
%%% with special attention to efficiency on MC68000 systems.
%%% 
%%% (STRING-SEARCH-FROM-EQUAL TARGET DOMAIN START)
%%% Like string-search-from except that the comparisons are case-insensitive.
%%% 
%%% (SUBSTRING= STRING1 STRING2 START LIMIT)
%%% Equivalent to (string= string1 (substring string2 start limit)), but
%%% more efficient.
%%% 
%%% (SUBSTRING-EQUAL STRING1 STRING2 START LIMIT)
%%% Equivalent to (string-equal string1 (substring string2 start limit),
%%% but more efficient.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% Implementation note: In both of these, the value of the first
%%% character of the target is precomputed and it is tested against
%%% characters of the domain separately from the other characters of
%%% the target.
