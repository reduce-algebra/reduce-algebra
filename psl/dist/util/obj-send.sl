% Revisions:
%
% 27-Feb-85 17:43:23 (Mike Creech)
%  Changed &primitive-type-call to take an extra argument that specifies
%  whether an error message should be issued. This is to fix a bug with
%  SEND-IF-HANDLES not returning NIL is an object is NOT given.
%  Changed &check-for-primitive-types to use this new &primitive-type-call.  
% 13-Jul-84 10:08:43 (Mike Creech)
%  Changed object-get-handler and object-get-handler-quietly to deal with primitive
%  types.  This includes the addition of &check-for-primitive-types and
%  &primitive-type-call.
% 11-Jul-84 16:07:43 (Mike Creech)
%  Added correct setting of flags *plap, *pgwd, and *pcmac in
%  &build-and-attach-method-hash-table. Made all routines that object-get-handler
%  calls be consistent with it as far as passing parameters.  All such routines
%  are passed the object information vector followed by the message name.
%  This involves changes to object-get-handler, object-get-handler-quietly,
%  &control-of-method-fetch, &build-hash-method-fetcher,
%  &make-and-attach-method-hash-table, &build-cond-method-fetcher, and
%  &return-fast-cond-body.
%  These changes will make message sending somewhat more efficient and conisistent
%  and allow for sending messages to other data types.
% 10-Jul-84 16:10:01 (Mike Creech)
%  Added to &klude-cont-error to print more intelligent error messages.
% 25-Apr-84 20:35:24 (Mike Creech)
%  Added deactivation of *usermode to &build-cond-method-fetcher.
%  Changed 'apply' in send-if-handles to 'idapply'
% 13 Apr 1984 1546-PST (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Removed load of fast-c-apply.
% 29-Mar-84 13:38:25 (Mike Creech)
%  Removed FAST-CODEAPPLY and references to IDAPPLY2.  Replaced with
%  references to smart CODEAPPLY and IDAPPLY.

% The object package consists of the files:
%     objects.sl      - Top level file that loads everything necessary to use objects.
%     obj-const.lap   - List of constants used by all object modules.
%     obj-dflavor.sl  - Code for defining a new type of object.
%     obj-dmethod.sl  - Code for defining a new method.
%     obj-hash.sl     - Code for hashing scheme used for method - function association 
%                       and instance variable - evector position.
%     objinstance.sl  - Code for making instances of objects.
%     obj-lib.sl      - Library of miscellaneous functions. Some are
%                       used by two or more object package files.
%     obj-send.sl     - Code for sending messages, tracing messages, and 
%                       creating the correct method fetching scheme (at runtime
%                       in the users program).
%     
% Because this file is only part of the object package, it only needs to load what
% is necessary to compile it.  objects.sl takes care of stuff needed at loadtime.
