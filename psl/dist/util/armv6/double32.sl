%   Subpackage for double length integer arithmetic; a double length 
%   integer is stored in a two word vector; the digits are compatible 
%   with the bignum digits 
%   Only those routines, wich are needed in the bignum package, are 
%   defined here. 
%
%   The boxes for the results of the operations are preallocated as  
%   warrays in order to reduce the dynamic heap consumption.        
%
%   This code is machine independent; however, it uses word arithmetic
%   of full length (e.g. 32 bits).
%
%   The machine dependent parts are defined in MULSL
