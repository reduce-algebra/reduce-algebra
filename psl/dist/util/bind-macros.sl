% Revisions:
%
% 6 May 1984 1640-PDT (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Changed compiletime loads requirements to allow separate compilation of
%  USEFUL modules.
% 09-Feb-84 15:37:52 (Cris Perdue)
%  Added compiletime load useful so this can be compiled by itself.
% 19 Jan 1984 1429-PST (Brian Beach)
%   Added standard header.
% 18-Oct-82 14:31:17, Edit by BENSON
%  Reversed vars and vals after collecting them in LET, so that the order
%  of things in the LAMBDA is the same as the LET.  Not necessary,
%  but it makes it easier to follow macroexpanded things.
