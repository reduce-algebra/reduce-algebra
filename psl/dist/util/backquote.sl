% Backquote is  similar  to MACLISP's  `  (that's backwards!)   mechanism.   In
% essence the  body  of  the  backquote is  quoted,  except  for  those  things
% surrounded by unquote, which are evaluated at macro expansion time.  UNQUOTEL
% splices in a  list, and  unquoted splices  in a  list destructively.   Mostly
% useful for defining macro's.
