%  2-Sep-88 (Russ Fish)
%   Function needed rather than ' in bottom level definer so things are
%   compiled.
% 19-May-87 (Russ Fish)
%   Another fix to &substitute-for-symbols: Needs to know about the variables
%   that are bound by prog and lambda special forms. 
% 16-Dec-85 10:04:20 (Russ Fish)
%   Fix &substitute-for-symbols.  Due to possible collisions between slot
%   names and functions with the same names, it needs to know more about
%   special forms a la macroexpand to avoid wiping out function names with
%   (egetv self nnn) substitutions.
% 27-Apr-84 13:52:38 (Mike Creech)
%   Comment changes and removed &build-method, &decide-on-method-searching-algorithm,
%   and &which-method-fetcher to obj-lib.sl.
% 26-Apr-84 09:41:07 (Mike Creech)
%   Changed and added some comments. Removed &flavor-define-method and moved
%   code into &build-method.  Fixed &substitute-myself to check that 'myself' is
%   not quoted before substituting.

% The object package consists of the files:
%     objects.sl      - Top level file that loads everything necessary to use objects.
%     obj-const.lap   - List of constants used by all object modules.
%     obj-dflavor.sl  - Code for defining a new type of object.
%     obj-dmethod.sl  - Code for defining a new method.
%     obj-hash.sl     - Code for hashing scheme used for method - function association 
%                       and instance variable - evector position.
%     objinstance.sl  - Code for making instances of objects.
%     obj-lib.sl      - Library of miscellaneous functions. Some are
%                       used by two or more object package files.
%     obj-send.sl     - Code for sending messages, tracing messages, and 
%                       creating the correct method fetching scheme (at runtime
%                       in the users program).
%     
% Because this file is only part of the object package, it only needs to load what
% is necessary to compile it.  objects.sl takes care of stuff needed at loadtime.

% DEFMETHOD - Define a method on an existing flavor.
%   
% Examples:
%
% (defmethod (complex-number real-part) ()
%   real-part)
%
% (defmethod (complex-number set-real-part) (new-real-part)

% The body of a method can freely refer to the instance variables of the flavor
% and can set them using SETF.  Each method defines a function FLAVOR$METHOD
% whose first argument is SELF, the object that is performing the method.  All
% references to instance variables (except within vectors or quoted lists) are
% translated to an invocation of the form (EGETV SELF n).
