% Revisions:
%
% 31 Jan 1984 (Cris Perdue)
%   Corrected macros to expand via (close ,var) rather than (close chan).
% 19 Jan 1984 1450-PST (Brian Beach)
%   Added standard header.
% 16 Nov 83, Cris Perdue
%   Changed use of $eof$ to (char eof) -- bug fix.
% 02-Sep-83 14:55:26, Cris Perdue
%   Changed with-input-from-string and with-input-from-terminated-string
%   to be macros with a "body" to be executed.  Unwind-protected them.
%   Removed string-readtoken.
%   Removed limitations about channel switching with string input
%   channels.
%   "Terminated" versions of these facilities are apparently unneeded.
