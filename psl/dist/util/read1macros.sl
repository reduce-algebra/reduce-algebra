%  Split read-macros.sl into two parts to allow them to be separately
%  compilable without requiring itself.  This part defines the
%  ` (backquote) read-macro necessary to compile the second part.
%  Since char-macro is being moved out of the kernel into useful, and
%  char-macro.sl needs this backquote stuff, modified this file to
%  not use CHAR.

%   Added standard header.
% 1 Feb 1983 1400-PST  (Cris Perdue)
%   Dochar moved into "nonkernel", "C" for "CONTROL", etc. commented out.
%   Many miscellaneous symbolic names for characters removed.
