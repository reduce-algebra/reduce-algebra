% Revisions:
%
% 14-Aug-84 13:16:22 (Mike Creech)
%   Fixed bug with saving the inherited flavors under *father-flavors* in
%   the function &build-flavor.
% 12-Jul-84 10:59:04 (Mike Creech)
%   Changed the storage of *father-flavors* to be a list instead of an id (in
%   preparation for multiple inheritance.
% 30-Jun-84 22:08:12 (Mike Creech)
%   Added  storage of father-flavor under the property *father-flavors* under flavor name.
% 11-May-84 11:29:52 (Mike Creech)
%   Changed 'return-inherited-method-builder' to 'inherited-method-builder'
%   Changed 'build-inherited-methods' to 'register-inherited-methods'
%   These changes include defining methods as compile-time instead of at load-time.
% 05-May-84 10:09:42 (Mike Creech)
%   Fixed some comments related to the changes below.
% 02-May-84 13:19:20 (Mike Creech)
%   Added &build-flavor call for each method inherited at compile time.
%   Also moved (association-create) in defflavor up above inheritance code.
% 27-Apr-84 13:39:54 (Mike Creech)
%   Added new inheritance method definer. This includes changes to defflavor
%   the removal of &make-inherited-methods, &carful-car, &number-of-arguments,
%   and &make-variable-name.
% 25-Apr-84 20:46:53 (Mike Creech)
%   Changed some comments. Kludged up &number-of-arguments to return 0
%   if the function is not defined.  This will go away when the changed
%   inheritance is added.

% The object package consists of the files:

%     obj-const.lap   - List of constants used by all object modules.
%     obj-dflavor.sl  - Code for defining a new type of object.
%     obj-dmethod.sl  - Code for defining a new method.
%     obj-hash.sl     - Code for hashing scheme used for method - function association 
%                       and instance variable - evector position.
%     objinstance.sl  - Code for making instances of objects.
%     obj-lib.sl      - Library of miscellaneous functions. Some are

% arguments to MAKE-INSTANCE, or as initializing expressions in the variable
% list, or may be supplied by an INIT method (see MAKE-INSTANCE).
% Uninitializied instance variables are bound to *UNBOUND*.
% The funny-number example above is used throughout the defflavor code
% as an example.
% For a detailed example of defflavor, see PIG:OBJ-SPEC.IBM.
% Recognized options are:
