% Revisions:
%
% 06-Aug-89 (Tony Hearn)
%  Replaced > and < by greaterp and lessp resp.
% 26-Sep-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Moved two macros char-int and int-char to the top of the file since macros
%  should generally be defined before they are used.
% 11-Dec-84 13:54:42 (Cris Perdue)
%  Fixed upper bound test in digit-char: 10 --> 9.
% 02-Feb-84 17:00:17 (Cris Perdue)
%  Changed standard-charp to use char< rather than the not yet
%  existent char>=
% 18 Jan 1984 (Cris Perdue)
%  Changed a comment using "%" to use ";" as required.
% 11 Jan 1984 1917-PST (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Added standard file header.  Added contents of .BUILD file.
% 13 May 1983 1734-PDT (Cris Perdue)
%  Changed standard-charp to match new Common LISP, fixed
%  char-equal, lessp, greaterp to be correct.
% 2-Sep-82 14:22:45, Edit by BENSON
%  Fixed bug in CHAR-UPCASE and CHAR-DOWNCASE
