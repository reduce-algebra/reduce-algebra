% Edit by Russ Fish, Tue Oct 20 18:15 1987
%  Reorder the extensions list so 14-character filename Unix machines
%  don't always assume a truncated filename is a .build file.
% Edit by Tim Mueller, Mon Nov  3 11:18:47 1986
%  Converted to lisp syntax.
% Edit by Russ Fish, Sat Apr 14 07:37:25 1984
%  Add BuildErrorExit mode to return error status instead of ignoring it.
%  Look for other extensions: .r and .rl for rlisp, .lsp for lisp syntax.
%  Echo .build files as before, suppress echo for source files.
% Edit by MLG, 9 April 1983
%  added MakeBuildFilename, and ERRSET, so Build more  robust
%  and more like  Compile-file. Also turned off break,
%  and do closing FASLEND in case of error.
% Edit by Cris Perdue, 23 Mar 1983 0856-PST
%  Added BuildFileFormat for Apollo as requested by Kessler
% 07-Mar-83  Nancy Kendzierski
%  Added load if-system, since many .build files use the if_system macro.
% 09-Feb-83  MLG
%  Changed Buildformat to use $pl/
% <PSL.UTIL>BUILD.RED.3,  1-Dec-82 16:12:33, Edit by BENSON
%  Added if_system(HP9836, ... )
