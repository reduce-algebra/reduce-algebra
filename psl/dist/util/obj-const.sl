% The object package consists of the files:
%     objects.sl      - Top level file that loads everything necessary to use objects.
%     obj-const.lap   - List of constants used by all object modules.
%     obj-dflavor.sl  - Code for defining a new type of object.
%     obj-dmethod.sl  - Code for defining a new method.
%     obj-hash.sl     - Code for hashing scheme used for method - function association 
%                       and instance variable - evector position.
%     objinstance.sl  - Code for making instances of objects.
%     obj-lib.sl      - Library of miscellaneous functions. Some are
%                       used by two or more object package files.
%     obj-send.sl     - Code for sending messages, tracing messages, and 
%                       creating the correct method fetching scheme (at runtime
%                       in the users program).
