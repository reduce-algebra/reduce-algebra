% Other Files of Interest:
%
% The object package consists of the files:
%     objects.sl      - Top level file that loads everything necessary to use objects.
%     obj-const.lap   - List of constants used by all object modules.
%     obj-dflavor.sl  - Code for defining a new type of object.
%     obj-dmethod.sl  - Code for defining a new method.
%     obj-hash.sl     - Code for hashing scheme used for method - function association 
%                       and instance variable - evector position.
%     objinstance.sl  - Code for making instances of objects.
%     obj-lib.sl      - Library of miscellaneous functions. Some are
%                       used by two or more object package files.
%     obj-send.sl     - Code for sending messages, tracing messages, and 
%                       creating the correct method fetching scheme (at runtime
%                       in the users program).
%     
% Because this file is only part of the object package, it only needs to load what
% is necessary to compile it.  objects.sl takes care of stuff needed at loadtime.

% DECLARE-FLAVOR
%
% *** Read these warnings carefully! ***
%
% The DECLARE-FLAVOR macro allows you to declare that a specific symbol is
% bound to an object of a specific flavor.  This allows the flavors
% implementation to eliminate the run-time method lookup normally associated
% with sending a message to that variable, which can result in an appreciable
% improvement in execution speed.  This feature is motivated solely by
% efficiency considerations and should be used ONLY where the performance
% improvement is critical.
% 
% Details: if you declare the variable X to be bound to an object of flavor
% FOO, then WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE DECLARATION (see below), expressions of
% the form (=> X GORP ...)  or (SEND X 'GORP ...)  will be replaced by function
% invocations of the form (FOO$GORP X ...).  Note that there is no check made
% that the flavor FOO actually contains a method GORP.  If it does not, then a
% run-time error "Invocation of undefined function FOO$GORP" will be reported.
% 
% WARNING: The DECLARE-FLAVOR feature is not presently well integrated with
% the compiler.  Currently, the DECLARE-FLAVOR macro may be used only as a
% top-level form, like the PSL FLUID declaration.  It takes effect for all
% code evaluated or compiled henceforth.  Thus, if you should later compile a
% different file in the same compiler, the declaration will still be in
% effect!  THIS IS A DANGEROUS CROCK, SO BE CAREFUL!  To avoid problems, I
% recommend that DECLARE-FLAVOR be used only for uniquely-named variables.
% The effect of a DECLARE-FLAVOR can be undone by an UNDECLARE-FLAVOR, which
% also may be used only as a top-level form.  Therefore, it is good practice
% to bracket your code in the source file with a DECLARE-FLAVOR and a
% corresponding UNDECLARE-FLAVOR.
%
% Here are the syntactic details:
%
% (DECLARE-FLAVOR FLAVOR-NAME VAR1 VAR2 ...)
% (UNDECLARE-FLAVOR VAR1 VAR2 ...)

% *** Did you read the above warnings??? ***
