%  Mar 11 1986, Russ Fish
%    More precise definitions of floating point constants now work.
% 9 Jan 1985 1716-PST (Cris Perdue)
%  Installed new definition of MOD with compiletime load of
%  useful to support it.  Old definition was buggy.
% 02-Dec-83 18:07:29 (Nancy Kendzierski)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
% 02-Dec-83 15:54:03  Nancy Kendzierski
%   Changed 'newnam stuff to setq's of fluids, since 'newnam is an rlisp-only
%   hack.
% 01-Dec-83 19:21:50  Nancy Kendzierski
%   Changed numbers to correct round-off problem w/un-rlisp.  Since this was
%   done by hand, the process was prone to error.  I don't know if I got them
%   all correct.
% 1 July 1983, Martin Griss                                               
%   LPRIM replaced by ERRORPRINTF so works from BARE-PSL                  
% MATHLIB.RED, 16-Dec-82 21:56:52, Edit by GALWAY                         
%   Various fixes and enhancements too numerous for me to remember.        
%   Includes fixes in SQRT function, modifications of RANDOM and other     
%   functions to bring them more in line with Common Lisp, addition of MOD 
%   and FLOOR.                                                             
% <PSL.UTIL>MATHLIB.RED.13, 13-Sep-82 08:49:52, Edit by BENSON            
%   Bug in EXP, changed 2**N to 2.0**N                                      
% <PSL.UTIL>MATHLIB.RED.12,  2-Sep-82 09:22:19, Edit by BENSON            
%   Changed all calls in REDERR to calls on STDERROR                        
% <PSL.UTIL>MATHLIB.RED.2, 17-Jan-82 15:48:21, Edit by GRISS

% Most of these routines not very heavily tested.                          
%
% Should these names be changed so that they all begin with an F or some   
% other distinguishing mark?  Are they in conflict with anything?  Or should
% we wait until we have packages?                                          
% Consider using Sasaki's BigFloat package -- it has all this and more, to 
% arbitrary precision.  The only drawback is speed.
