% Revisions:
%
% 14-Sep-84 12:23:39 (Vicki O'Day)
%  Changed vector-upper-bound so it doesn't add 1 to size of vector,
%  and vector-size so it does.
% 29-Mar-84 14:11:09 (Brian Beach)
%  Changed for new fast function model in compiler using FAST-FUNCTION
%  property.
% 19 Jan 1984 1432-PST (Brian Beach)
%   Added standard header.
% 21-Jun-83 14:41:52, Cris Perdue
%   Added the fast-vectors switch with enable and disable functions.
