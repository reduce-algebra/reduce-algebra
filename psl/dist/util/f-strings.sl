% Revisions:
%
% 10-Sep-88 (Tony Hearn)
%  Corrected misspelling of fast-string-empty?.
% 29-Mar-84 14:29:14 (Brian Beach)
%  Changed for new fast function model in compiler using FAST-FUNCTION property.
% 19 Jan 1984 1431-PST (Brian Beach)
%   Added standard header.
% 23 June 1983, Cris Perdue
%   Added fast-strings switch with enable and disable functions.
%   Now imports rather than loading slow-strings.
%   Makes fast-vector available at runtime, as really required.
