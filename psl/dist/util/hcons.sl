% Summary of "user level" functions provided:
% (DM Hcons (X) ...)  % Nary hashed cons, right associative.
% (DN Hlist (X) ...)  % Hcons version of "list" function.

% Hcons version of "copy" function.  Note that unlike copy, this is not
% guaranteed to create a new copy of a structure. (In fact, rather the
% opposite.)
% (DE Hcopy (lst) ...)

% (DE Happend (U V) ...) % Hcons version of "append" function.
% (DE Hreverse (U) ...)  % Hcons version of "reverse" function.

% Pairs for property list functions must be created by Hcons.
% Get property of id or pair.
% (DE extended-get (id-or-pair  indicator) ...)
% Put property of id or pair.  Known to setf.
% (DE extended-put (id-or-pair indicator val) ...)


% Number of hash "slots" in table, should be a prime number to get an even
% spread of hits (??).  This package has been written so that it should be
% possible to modify this size at runtime (I hope).  So if the hash-tables
% get too heavily loaded they can be copied to larger ones.
