% Revisions:
%
% 6 May 1984 1636-PDT (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Changed compiletime loads requirements to allow separate compilation of
%  USEFUL modules.
% 8 Mar 1984 1542-PST (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Added XOR back in -- nmode uses it.
% 19 Jan 1984 1431-PST (Brian Beach)
%  Added standard header.
% 08 Feb 1984 (Cris Perdue)
%  Commented out defn. of XOR (I hope it's not used), added compiletime
%  load useful to make this stand on its own.
