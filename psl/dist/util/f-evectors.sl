%%% This is a facility so the user can generate code to access
%%% evectors that runs fast.  To use this facility, LOAD (don't
%%% IMPORT) it at compiletime.  It does an (on fast-evectors),
%%% turning on the generation of faster code.  (Still, in case it
%%% is already loaded and turned off, you should turn it on
%%% explicitly.)  The feature may be turned off and on by the
%%% user.  The affected evector functions are EGetV, EPutV,
%%% EUpBV, and ESizeV.
