  % Builds the function linkage by hand, without use of the compiler.
  % First, some BPS is allocated, and code is placed in it to jump to
  % the called function.
  % CODE-BASE points to the start of the segment allocated by GTBPS, where
  % the argument count resides.
  % CODE-ADDRESS points to the beginning of the actual code.

    (setf (getmem (wplus2 code-address 2)) called-address)

    % Now the code is built.  Next we make a code pointer that points to
    % it and plant it in the function cell of the newly defined function:
