% 11-Jan-84 15:21:01 (Jim Ambras)
%  Added compile-time load of rlisp.
% 05-Dec-83 14:23:28 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.  Got rid for FOR redefinition kludge, 
%   replaced with WFOR.  (definition of WFOR is in SYS-MACROS.SL)

%  <PSL.COMP>SYSLISP-SYNTAX.RED.2, 30-Mar-83 11:05:36, Edit by KENDZIERSKI
%  Included the text from syslisp-syntax.build at the beginning of this file.
%  The file names w/extensions were too large for the VAX to deal with.
%  <PSL.COMP>SYSLISP-SYNTAX.RED.3,  5-May-82 11:33:48, Edit by BENSON
%  Wrapped if GetD 'BEGIN1 around parser calls
