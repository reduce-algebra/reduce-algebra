% Usage: These are macros because we do not want to incur a function
%        call overhead to convert argument types.  To use these functions
%        you must load this file at compile time to compile files with
%        calls to these macros, or load time, if you run interpreted code
%        using these functions.  If you use the functions which acces
%        C global variables then this file must be loaded at load time.
%
%        If you have a C function name _foo which takes a character
%        and a string and returns a string, you would write the Lisp
%        function which calls it as:
%
%        (flag '(_foo) 'foreignfunction)
%
%        (de foo (c s)
%          (string-from-c (_foo (char-to-c c) (string-to-c s))))
 
% From psl to c.
 
% Used to send a word of bits to C without conversion.
(defmacro bits-to-c (b>)
  b>)
 
(defmacro boolean-to-c (flag>)
  `(if ,flag> 1 0))
 
(defmacro char-to-c (c>)
  `(character ,c>))
 
(defmacro c-ptr-to-c (p>)
  `(int2sys ,p>))
 
% If the C routine expects a float (double), not a pointer to a double
% then the two words of the double must be placed on the stack.  The
% following two routines accomplish this.
% VAX-dependency: (float1-to-c f) must be followed with (float2-to-c f):
%
%        (de foo (f)
%          (float-from-c (_foo (float1-to-c f) (float2-to-c f))))
%
% Depending on stack direction this may need to be reversed on some machines.

% Pointer access to some bottom-level PSL datastructures.
% WARNING: The pointers returned by these functions will be invalidated when a
% garbage collection relocates a items stored in the heap.  It is only safe
% if you do NOTHING that allocates heap space between the time the pointer
% is computed and when it is used (typically by passing it to C code.)
% Exceptions are print names of symbols (id2String), which
% are statically allocated in BPS space and not garbage collected;
% static word vectors in WArray space, like that returned by the static-Words
% function below.  However, the system may change, so relying on GC
% protection is dangerous.
 
% STRING-PTR
% Given a string. Returns a pointer to the body of the string.

% STATIC-WORDS
% Given the number of words to allocate (one more than the indexing bound).
% Allocate a chunk of WArray space, which is not garbage collected.
% Returns a word-vector object, which can be accessed by indexing.
