% codeTemplate - a utility for defining chunks of code, typically in the
% body of a macro which constructs functions, with optional substitution
% of parameters.  CodeTemplate is actually a frontend to the backQuote
% macro, in a form which is useful in Rlisp syntax.  Parameters are
% wrapped in unQuote or unQuoteL in the returned backQuote form.
%
% CodeTemplate takes a variable number of arguments, with the last one
% being the body of code to be returned.  All arguments but the last one
% are assumed to be specifications for parameters which will be
% subsituted into the code body.  A specification consists of a parameter
% id, possibly followed by a single expression argument to be substituted.
% If the expession argument is omitted, the id is used as the expression.
% 
% The expression will be substituted into the code body wherever the id is
% seen, as "unQuote expr".  Evalutation occurs in the environment which
% invoked codeTemplate.
% 
% If the id is prefixed with an "at" (@) in the code body, eg.  "!@foo",
% unQuoteL will be used instead of unQuote, resulting in removal of the top
% level of parens.  This is useful in cases such as splicing a set of
% arguments into the middle of a function call.
