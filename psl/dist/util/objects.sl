% Revisions:
%
% 26-Sep-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Changed all loadtime statements to Bothtimes since the there are object
%  definitions at the end of the file.
% 13-Jul-84 10:20:44 (Mike Creech)
%   Added primitive type definitions and making of global instances of these types.
% 01-May-84 13:16:32 (Mike Creech)
%   Added (loadtime (load fc-indirect)).
% 25-Apr-84 09:55:30 (Mike Creech)
%   Added (loadtime (load common)). Changed some comments.
% 03-Apr-84 16:14:58 (Mike Creech)
%   Added (loadtime (load useful)) to pull in macro expansion capability.
% 02-Mar-84 15:56:02 (Mike Creech)
%   Completely revised.  Split up into seperate modules.

% Other Files of Interest:
%
% The object package consists of the files:
%     objects.sl      - Top level file that loads everything necessary to use objects.
%     obj-const.lap   - List of constants used by all object modules.
%     obj-dflavor.sl  - Code for defining a new type of object.
%     obj-dmethod.sl  - Code for defining a new method.
%     obj-hash.sl     - Code for hashing scheme used for method - function association 
%                       and instance variable - evector position.
%     objinstance.sl  - Code for making instances of objects.
%     obj-lib.sl      - Library of miscellaneous functions. Some are
%                       used by two or more object package files.
%     obj-send.sl     - Code for sending messages, tracing messages, and 
%                       creating the correct method fetching scheme (at runtime
%                       in the users program).
%     
% Because this file is only part of the object package, it only needs to load what
% is necessary to compile it.  objects.sl takes care of stuff needed at loadtime.

% Declare the global instances used to send primitve types messages efficiently.
