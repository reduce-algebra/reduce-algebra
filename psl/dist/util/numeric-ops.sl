% Revisions:
%
% 02-Sep-87 (Leigh Stoller for Russ Fish)
%  Use IntLShift instead of WShift for right shift on the VAX.
% 02-Oct-84 16:40:22 (Cris Perdue)
%  Added fix to numeric-for-from-function like one already made
%  in pu:for-macro.sl so case where expression giving
%  termination value is NIL and the step is not a literal number
%  can work correctly.
% 1 May 1984 0945-PDT (Cris Perdue)
%  Added a non-open-coded definition for /=, which had been
%  omitted up to now.
% 6 Mar 1984 1731-PST (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Changed "fast" interaction by renaming for-from-function to 
%  numeric-for-from-function and changing the property list of 'from
%  as fast-integers are enabled and disabled.
% 21-Mar-84 16:21:40 (Brian Beach)
%  Updated for new compiler model.  CMACRO properties changes to FAST-FUNCTION
%  properties.
% 19 Jan 1984 1445-PST (Brian Beach)
%   Added standard header.

% Edit by Cris Perdue, 19 Apr 1983 1417-PST
% Disable-fast-numeric-operators now remprops fast-plus and fast-times
%  as it should.
% Edit by Cris Perdue,  7 Mar 1983 1131-PST
% Redefined + and * to take any number of arguments.
% This involved defining exprs fast-plus and fast-times.
% Added an error check to - and /

% WARNING: + and * are no longer exprs.  Code using this module and COMPILED
% with the fast-integers switch set to NIL will not work until it is
% recompiled. /csp

% Note: This must be LOAD, not IMPORTS. /csp
(load useful)

% This file defines a set of C-like numeric operators that are a superset of the
% numeric operators defined by the Common Lisp compatibility package.

% The operators are:
%
%	=	Numeric Equal
%	/=	Numeric Not Equal (common lisp)
%	~=	Numeric Not Equal (CLU)
%	<	Numeric Less Than
%	>	Numeric Greater Than
%	<=	Numeric Less Than or Equal
%	>=	Numeric Greater Than or Equal
%	+	Numeric Addition
%	-	Numeric Minus or Subtraction
%	*	Numeric Multiplication
%	/	Numeric Division
%	//	Numeric Remainder
%	~	Integer Bitwise Logical Not
%	&	Integer Bitwise Logical And
%	|	Integer Bitwise Logical Or
%	^	Integer Bitwise Logical Xor
%	<<	Integer Bitwise Logical Left Shift
%	>>	Integer Bitwise Logical Right Shift

% +, -, *, and / are defined as in Common LISP, but when compiled they
% do open-coded arithmetic only, just like all the other operators.
% The arithmetic relational operators all take exactly 2 arguments,
% unlike the genuine Common LISP versions.

% The switch FAST-INTEGERS controls an option that provides for an efficient
% compiled implementation of these operators using Syslisp arithmetic.  When the
% switch is on, uses of these operators will compile into the corresponding
% Syslisp arithmetic operators, which generally are open-compiled and fast.
% However, the Syslisp operators perform machine arithmetic on untagged
% integers: they will work only if their inputs are untagged integers, and they
% produce untagged integer outputs.  The (undocumented) functions Int2Sys and
% Sys2Int can be used to convert between tagged Lisp integers and Syslisp
% integers; however, no conversion is needed to convert between INUMs and
% Syslisp integers within the valid range of INUMs.

% This module modifies the FOR macro to use the numeric operators to implement
% the FROM clause; thus, the FOR statement will use Syslisp arithmetic when the
% FAST-INTEGERS switch is on.

%
% The following functions are defined in the COMMON package:
%   =, <, >, <=, >=, +, -, *, /
%
