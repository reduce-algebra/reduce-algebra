%  Split read-macros.sl into two parts to allow them to be separately
%  compilable without requiring itself.  The first part defines the
%  ` (backquote) read-macro necessary to compile this part.
% 19 Jan 1984 1449-PST (Brian Beach)
%   Added standard header.
% 1 Feb 1983 1400-PST  (Cris Perdue)
%   Dochar moved into "nonkernel", "C" for "CONTROL", etc. commented out.
%   Many miscellaneous symbolic names for characters removed.
