% Revisions:
%
% 6 May 1984 1836-PDT (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Added compiletime loads to allow separate compilation.
% 24 Apr 1984 1348-PST (Brian Beach)
%  Changed CAR to SAFECAR in MACROEXPAND-FUNCTION-CALL, since not all functions
%  will have definitions.
% 13-Feb-84 09:51:37 (Alan Snyder)
%  Fixed missing second argument to macroexpand2-list in macroexpand-cond.
% 07-Feb-84 14:22:26 (Brian Beach)
%  Repaired bug expanding lambdas.  In expanding a DE, the parameter list was
%  being handled as a function call.  Fixed this by making the handling of
%  lambdas more general, so that they are allowed to occur.  Rather than add
%  handling of FUNCTION as an fexpr, I have simply handled LAMBDA as a special
%  case, since this is the way HPSL will define it.
% 19 Jan 1984 1443-PST (Brian Beach)
%   Added standard header.
% 8 Jul 1983 1804-PDT, Cris Perdue
%   Added coverage for CATCH and CASE, which means every FEXPR
%   except DEFSTRUCT and perhaps WDECLARE is now handled.
% 17-June-83 Alan Snyder
%   Taught it about the LIST Fexpr (needed to make Objects work).
%  <PSL.UTIL>MACROEXPAND.SL.15,  2-Sep-82 10:32:10, Edit by BENSON
%   Fixed multiple argument SETQ macro expansion
