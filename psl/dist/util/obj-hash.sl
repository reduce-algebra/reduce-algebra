%
% 12-Jul-84 10:39:12 (Mike Creech)
%    Changed parameters to &method-hash-get from message-name object to
%    object-info message-name.  Removed the code that got the object information
%    vector.
% 25-Apr-84 19:13:49 (Mike Creech)
%    Added hash table initialization crock (see below).
%    Changed igetv and iputv to vector-fetch and vector-store.
% 02-Mar-84 16:02:17 (Mike Creech)
%    Fixed header.
% 26-Jan-84 15:42:07 (Mike Creech)
%    Made it so object package constants are dskin'd.
% 17-Jan-84 13:32:42 (Mike Creech)
%    Hipo'ed up hasher (&get-method-hash-address).

% NOTE: 1) This is an implementation dependent module!
%          It will only run compiled and must be updated when id's are
%          stored differently in the language.  See the comments for 
%          the macro &get-method-hash-address.
%          This will go away when HPSL gives an efficient hashing function.
%       2) This module also initializes the hash tables to the value:
%               (@$&*funkysymbol*&$@)
%          This is a crock to allow use to not check for NIL when
%          doing &method-hash-get or &instance-hash-get.
%          This crock should be removed and the hash tables set to NIL
%          values when an extremely fast safecar is written (as an anyreg).
%       3) Remove compatibility code from &no-hash-element? after
%          everything has been compiled using new hash scheme.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Other Files of Interest:
%
% The object package consists of the files:
%     objects.sl      - Top level file that loads everything necessary to use objects.
%     obj-const.lap   - List of constants used by all object modules.
%     obj-dflavor.sl  - Code for defining a new type of object.
%     obj-dmethod.sl  - Code for defining a new method.
%     obj-hash.sl     - Code for hashing scheme used for method - function association 
%                       and instance variable - evector position.
%     objinstance.sl  - Code for making instances of objects.
%     obj-lib.sl      - Library of miscellaneous functions. Some are
%                       used by two or more object package files.
%     obj-send.sl     - Code for sending messages, tracing messages, and 
%                       creating the correct method fetching scheme (at runtime
%                       in the users program).
%     
% Because this file is only part of the object package, it only needs to load what
% is necessary to compile it.  objects.sl takes care of stuff needed at loadtime.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Hash functions are as follows:
%
% (&method-hash-put hash-table key element) :
%      using 1 key, insert the element into the method hash table.
%      replaces any previous hash on the same key.
%
% (&instance-hash-put hash-table key element) :
%      using 1 key, insert the element into the instance variable hash table.
%      replaces any previous hash on the same key.
%
% (&method-hash-get object-info message-name) :
%      using message-name as a key, get the element associated with this key 
%      in the method hash table.  If none, return NIL.
%
% (&instance-hash-get hash-table key) :
%      using 1 key, get the element associated with this key 
%      in the instance hash table.  If none, returns NIL.
%
% (&make-method-hash-table) : returns a method hash table.
%
% (&make-instance-hash-table) : returns an instance hash table.
