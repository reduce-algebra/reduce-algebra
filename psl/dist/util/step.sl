% Revisions:
%
% 10-Jan-85 19:02:27 (Cris Perdue)
%  Removed loading of rawio and rawbreak.  Fixed value returned by the
%  function STEP.  Fixed redefinitions of keyboard-input-character and
%  of pbout.  Changed use of ouch to use writechar instead.  Fixed problem
%  with prompt string.  Modified printout to end with EOL so output is
%  flushed to the NMODE buffer.
% 19 Jan 1984 1450-PST (Brian Beach)
%   Added standard header.
% 7 October 1983, MLgriss
%		Improve Interface to NMODE, using (write-message ...)
% 5 October 1983,  MLGriss
%		Defined a dummy KEYBOARD-INPUT-CHARACTER and WRITE-PROMPT
%		for NMODE compatibility
%		Added *VERBOSE-STEP switch	
%		Reduce needs for runtime modules in BARE and NMODE
%		Improve interface of BREAK and STEP to permit
%		recovery from CONT errors inside step.
%		Replace a first in STEP-EVAL by safe-first
% 3 October 1983, MLGriss
%		Change MAKE-VECTOR to init to NIL
%		Put COMPILETIME load ClComp, change ; to % before, remove 
%			.BUILD
%		Embed BREAK loop to turn off stepper if error during step
%		Load RAWIO, RawBreak

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The various redefinitions in this file are basically crocks because
% this assumes it is loaded after facilities such as NMODE, but it
% isn't worth it to try to make them right. /csp
