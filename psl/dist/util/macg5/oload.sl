% Revisions:

%  Newforeign calls makeforeigncode instead of makefcode to simplify
%  foreign function interface for sparc.
% 06-Feb-87 8:14 (Harold Carr)
%  Changed call (gtbps nil) to (free-bps).
%  Changed oload prog variables NEXTBPS and LASTBPS to OLOAD-NEXTBPS
%  and OLOAD-LASTBPS, since in 3.4 they are fluids (in 3.2 they were
%  built into the kernel, and the prog binding (to nil) interferes with
%  gtbps.
%  Put call to makefcode back in NEWFOREIGNFN so that the addresses get
%  installed, (why would anyone remove it?).
% 27-Oct-84 8:14 (Brian Beach)
%  Updated for micro-kernel:  Removed load of SYSLISP, changed (ON SYSLISP)
%  to (ON FAST-INTEGERS).
% 13-Jan-84 10:23:25 (Brian Beach)
%  Added standard header.  Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.

% oload - invokes the loader, making a number of .oload.* files on the
% connected directory, then pulls a successful result into the BPS area of
% the PSL.  Argument is a string containing a list of one or more .o and
% .a filename paths and flags to "ld", such as -l flags specifying libraries
% to search.  If the argument string is NIL, the oload script is
% skipped, and it is assumed that you are going to perform the same load
% over again.  This requires that the BPS and WARRRAY base addresses are
% the same as when the original oload was done.
%
% Return value is NIL if the oload failed, T if it worked.
