% Revisions:
%
% 11-Dec-84 16:35:15 (Lucy Berlin)
%  Loaded sys-consts & removed setq of maxargs.
% 14-Nov-84 10:24:44 (Lucy Berlin)
%  Changed wrap to refer to switch *pwrds rather than *pwds.
% 13-Nov-84 17:36:09 (Lucy Berlin)
%  Redefined the switch *pwds locally within a part of fn wrap. (To suppress
%  the message *** fn-name: base 16#FF...., length 10#.... bytes
%  when compiling a wrapper.)
% 12-Nov-84 17:27:57 (Lucy Berlin)
%  Fixed bug in search-for-wrapper, & in setting 'wrapper-type property.
%  Now 'wrapped-definition contains just the pointer to the next layer,
%  and 'wrapper-type holds the name of the wrapper type.
% 12-Nov-84 16:13:06 (Lucy Berlin)
%  Added the public function (compiled-wrapper-only-fns), and made
%  unwind-protect a member of non-interp-wrappable-fns.
%  set maxargs = 20 for lack of a better thing to do.
% 07-Nov-84 09:00:17 (Cris Perdue)
%  (newid fn) ==> (newid (id2string fn)).
% 02-Nov-84 17:11:48 (Cris Perdue)
%  Now wrapping of functions with "any" number of arguments is
%  prohibited.  (These are inherited method functions).  Fixed a bug
%  in wrapping of undefined functions.  Wrappers now take the name
%  of the basic function, but are uninterned.
% 30-Oct-84 18:13:25 (Cris Perdue)
%  Added the concept of functions that are not wrappable.
% 25-Oct-84 11:09:48 (Cris Perdue)
%  Changed wrap and remove-wrapper to rebind *usermode and
%  *redefmsg to nil.
% 09-Oct-84 15:57:33 (Cris Perdue)
%  Extended WRAP to handle a lambda expression in place of the
%  previous BODY argument.  If a lambda expression is supplied,
%  only the symbol WRAPPED-FUNCTION is substituted for rather
%  than occurrences of the expression (wrapped-invocation).  A
%  function may now have more than one wrapper of each type.
%  New wrappers are for now always added as the outermost of
%  their type.
% 10-May-84 17:17:42 (Bob Shaw)
%  Changed occurrence of < to lessp.

% Overview:
% 
% A wrapper conceptually is a redefinition of a function.
% Usually a wrapper calls the previous definition, doing
% some additional work before and/or after calling the previous
% definition.  Typically a wrapper may be added to a
% function and later removed.  A function potentially may be
% wrapped up inside more than one wrapper at the same
% time.  The user may decide to redefine a function that is
% wrapped or to access its definition.  This facility does
% bookkeeping to support these operations on functions that may
% or may not already be wrapped.
% 
% The wrapper-standard-order supports keeping "advice"
% inside breaking inside tracing, etc..
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Issue: can we arrange better names for wrappers?  A problem is
% that each wrapper knows the identity of the function it calls,
% so wrappers "must" work by putting a new definition on an
% existing symbol, or it will never get called.  Problem is
% that a symbol may be associated with different wrappers at
% different times.  Possible approach: give the FUNDEFs of
% wrappers names appropriate to the type of wrapper.
