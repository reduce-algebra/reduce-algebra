% Revisions:
%
% 6 May 1984 1621-PDT (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Added compiletime loads and split into two parts to allow separate
%  compilation, without requiring itself.
% 19 Jan 1984 1431-PST (Brian Beach)
%   Added standard header.
% 03-Nov-83 16:39:02  Nancy Kendzierski
%   Removed circularity in rebuilding USEFUL by removing use of SETF in this
%   file.  Changed "setf (get '!%displaced-macro 'compfn) #'&comprogn)" to
%   "(put '!%displaced-macro 'compfn #'&comprogn)".  SETF isn't defined in the
%   module USEFUL until after defmacro.sl is processed -- setf is defined
%   in set-macros.sl, using defmacro, which is defined in this file!
