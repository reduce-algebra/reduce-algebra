%%% (natural-merge-sort list compare-fn)
%%% Returns the elements of the list, destructively sorted.
%%% The value, not the input, must be used.
%%% This function uses "natural merging" rather than merging of
%%% fixed-size groups.  If there are runs of elements already in
%%% order, the runs will be merged as units.
%%% 
%%% (natural-merge list1 list2 compare-fn)
%%% Returns the elements of the two lists, destructively merged.
%%% 
%%% Both of these functions are carefully written to run fast.
%%% The sort runs particularly fast if the list to be sorted has
%%% runs of elements already in order.
