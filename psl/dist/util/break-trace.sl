% Revisions:
%
% 20-Dec-84 16:43:00 (Lucy Berlin)
%  Modified unwrap-wrapper, do-untrace, do-unbreak to do more errorchecking,
%  and to return functions successfuly unwrapped.  Modified do-restore
%  to use do-unbreak, do-untrace, and to return T.
% 19-Dec-84 17:20:42 (Lucy Berlin)
%  Fixed  bug in unwrap-wrapper, so that it uses new method-function accessor.
% 14-Dec-84 16:39:55 (Lucy Berlin)
%  Redefined breakpoint to take optional parameters of a format string and
% any number of arguments.

%------------------------------ TO DO: ---------------------------------------
%  FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
%. do not return the method-fn name, or print self when tracing a method.
%  -- do when new objects come out.
%. extend to handle Commmon LISP constructs: &optional, &rest, &key parameters,
%     multiple values returned by functions, etc.
%  POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS:
%. prettyprinting structured arguments & return values, overflow lines.
%  - use Alan Foster's pp?
%. trace output redirection to history file - rebind *trace-output*?
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   KNOWN BUGS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%. wrapping some fns used within NMODE may cause nmode to crash.
%. debug output doesn't do %f properly when buffer is both input & output channel.
