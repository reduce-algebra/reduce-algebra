% Revisions:
%
% 9-May-84 11:11  (William Galway)
%  Added (LOAD STRINGS) so that string-concat will work.
% 7-May-84 22:34  (William Galway)
%  Added if_system for Vax/Unix
% 23-Apr-84 09:06:22  (Robert Kessler)
%  Added if_system for the Cray.
% 21-Mar-84 21:21  (William Galway)
%  Misc cosmetic changes, mostly work on the TIMER macro so that it prints
%  information in a more readable format.  Moved call RECLAIM to come
%  before printing of test message, commented out stuff for printing
%  wholine time.   Timing tests now bracketed with dashes and start with an
%  identifier-string passed as an argument to the TIMER macro.
% 19-Mar-84 23:06   (William Galway)
%  Converted "//$" to "/$", since that's what the MacLisp function is
%  really called.  Confusion was caused by use of "/" as an escape
%  character in MacLisp.
% 6-Mar-84 21:15:47 (William Galway)
%  Moved LOAD of numeric operators to the front so that the definition of
%  DECLARE in this file isn't overridden by the loading of the COMMON
%  library later on.
% 6-Mar-84 10:26:50 (William Galway)
%  Converted FEXPRs into MACROs.  Changed some code to use READ-FROM-STRING
%  instead of COMPRESS/EXPLODE.  Added Jerry Duggan's stuff for
%  DATE-AND-TIME and LOADAV (inside of If_System DEC-20).  Also added stuff
%  to set up the global variable "MACHINE".
%
% 05-Mar-84 15:45:07 (Robert Kessler)
%  Added Machine to print, so we can tell which machine test was run
%  on.  Also, added a reclaim at the top, so when the test is run as a
%  file, all instances will start with the same amount of memory.
%  Finally, put in the useful functions that allow the code to be run
%  without much change.
