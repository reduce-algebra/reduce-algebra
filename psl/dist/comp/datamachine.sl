% Revisions:
%
% 4 Dec 1984 1040-PST (Brian Beach)
%  Removed SETF-SAFE flag on FIELD.  On the DEC-20 and Vax it is not.
% 29-Oct-84 (Brian Beach)
%  Added VECBASE and WRDBASE.
% 04-Jun-84 12:50:06 (Brian Beach)
%  Removed IF_SYSTEM.  Added module SYS-DM for system-specific stuff.
% 25-Apr-84 08:53:18 (Brian Beach)
%  Added Cris's changes: removed tags, added load of sys-consts.
% 1-Mar-84 10:00:00 (Brian Beach)
%  Replaces WARRAYS, WVARS by fluids.
% 22-Nov-83 (Brian Beach)
%  Translated from RLISP to LISP.  Removed definitions for open-coded
%  functions that were commented out.  Changed symbal table macros
%  (SYMVAL, PUTSYMVAL, etc), to use WARRAY prefix.  Changed OBARRAY
%  macro to use WCONST prefix.  Made macros more readable by using
%  substitution macros.  Added appropriate SETF-SAFE flags so that 
%  the SETF in useful can be used.
