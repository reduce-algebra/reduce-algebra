% Revisions:
%
% 15-Aug-87 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Removed all internal functions. No longer considered proper.
% 23-Mar-84 07:28:36 (Brian Beach)
%  Removed wconstevaluable-for-compiler.  Now handled by CONSTANT? and others.
% 02-Mar-84 09:02:54 (Jim Ambras/CRC)
%  Corrected file header.
% 17-Jan-84 12:00:50 (Tim Tillson)
%  Added wconstevaluable-for-compiler, which evaluates expressions only if the
%  functions have the DOFN property (was a bug in ASSOCPV in compiler.sl).
% 06-Dec-83 10:00 (Brian Beach)
%   New header.
% 20-NOV-83 Mark R. Swanson
%  Added Expand3OperandCMacro to support !specifically! !*MkBPtr cmacro
% November 10, 1983  Brian Beach
%   Changed WCONSTEVALUABLE so that it handles expressions with
%   explicit WCONSTs.
% June 29, 1983  Michael Creech
%   Minor code changes for efficiency and commented the code.

%
% General questions and comments:
%    - I believe the DOFN property is NOT needed as far as this module
%      is concerned.  This is because it maps to real lisp functions
%      that can be used anyway.  For example, (WCONSTEVALUABLE
%      '(WPLUS2 3 5) maps to (PLUS2 3 5) when DOFN is used.  However,
%      (PLUS2 3 5) is itself legal and will generate the value 8.
%
%    - Why does ResolveWConst return IMMEDIATE when the expression
%      is not a number?
%    
%    - Method of generating labels within CMACRO's should be cleaned up.
%      Currently, TempLabel!* and TempLabel2!* are used in a funny way.
%      They are defined as prog variables in CMacroSubstitute and
%      are set in TempLabelGen which is only used by PatternSublA.
%
%    - Find out if ok to change name of AnyRegPatternMatch to PatternMatch.
%      It is used for pattern matching for both anyreg's and cmacro's.
%      Need to find where else in the compiler it is used.
%    
%    - Functions order of definition should change.  All high-level ANYREG
%      and CMACRO expand functions should be at the top.
% 
%    - The current use of ResultingCode!* should change.  It is currently
%      very dangerous.  If AnyRegPatternExpand is ever called from a function
%      that doesn't have a fluid ResultingCode!*, it will fail.  This
%      currently works because a CMACRO expanding function is always
%      called at the highest level (these all define a prog variable
%      ResultingCode!*) even though many nested calls to ANYREG 
%      pattern exanders may be called (these don't define ResultingCode!*).
%
%    - Can ExpandThreeArgumentAnyreg go away? Where is it called?
%
% The calling structure of code in this module follows.  An indented
% function is called by a less indented function.  '*' means routine
% calls itself.  Comments may follow functions in parenthesis.

% operands that require a temporary for some reason (like *MOVE source

% just the last one.  This is done by returning the value of
