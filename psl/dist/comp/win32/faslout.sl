% Revisions:
%
% 10-Aug-88 (Chris Burdorf)
%  Replaced all the if's located inside "function" so that the compiler can
%  be loaded without having USEFUL loaded.
%
% 15-Aug-87 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Removed all internal functions. No longer considered proper.
% 07-Sep-86 (Leigh Stoller)
%  Changed > to greaterp in fasl-writename because a compiler module should
%  not depend on a utility module.
% 23 Jan 1985 0937-PST (Brian Beach)
%  Changed FASLOUT so that it returns T again.
% 15-Jan-85 15:49:52 (Brian Beach)
%  Added a fluid variable called FASL-IDNUMBER-PROPERTY* which is the name
%  of the property that id numbers are stored under.  This is to fix a problem
%  that occurrs when a compile is abnormally terminated, and another one
%  started where id numbers in the new compile are confused with id numbers
%  in the terminated compile that weren't cleaned up.
% 14-Nov-84 14:20:49 (Brian Beach)
%  Changed FASLABORT accoring to Utah fix so that the output file is closed
%  after the flags are reset, so that the system is left in a reasonable state
%  even if the file cannot be closed.
% 24-Oct-84 15:30:01 (Alan Snyder)
%  Install changes from Bob Morain:
%    Now turns off internalfunction flag at the end of the file to restore
%    compiler to good state.  Added a new internal function
%    DEALLOCATEFASLSPACES.  Flagged FASLABORT 'ignore to make it more useful;
%    made it call DEALLOCATEFASLSPACES.  Flush flagging of STARTUPTIME, which
%    is obsolete.  Changed FASLOUT-MAGIC to (COMPILER-CONSTANT
%    'FASLOUT-MAGIC).  Added FASL-PREEVAL* to parameterize the property looked
%    up by DFPRINTFASL; DFPRINTFASL can now be used (and is used) by ASMOUT.
%    Made FASL-FUNCTION call COMPD, which seems to do pretty much the same
%    things that FASL-FUNCTION did.  Remove redundant binding of
%    *WRITINGFASLFILE by DFPRINTFASL.
%  In addition:
%    Make FASLEND call FASLABORT to reduce duplicated code.
% 19-Oct-84 08:37:49 (Alan Snyder)
%  Fix another bug in 02-Oct-84 change: LOADTIME was calling FASL-FORM, which
%  interprets the IGNORE and EVAL flags (which implement COMPILETIME and
%  BOTHTIMES).  It appears that the behavior desired by PSL programmers is for
%  LOADTIME to force compiler output and prevent compiler execution, as in
%  (LOADTIME (ON FOO)), where ON is implicitly COMPILETIME.  This behavior
%  differs from Common Lisp EVAL-WHEN, where an (EVAL-WHEN (LOAD) ...) is a
%  no-op to the compiler (the body is compiled normally).  My fix is to add a
%  parameter to fasl-from and the faslpreeval functions and and pass this down
%  (to handle macro calls).
% 15-Oct-84 11:15:49 (Alan Snyder)
%  Fix bug in 02-Oct-84 change: Add ERRSET around invocation of TOPLOOPEVAL*.
% 02-Oct-84 09:23:07 (Alan Snyder)
%   Restructured DFPRINTFASL for much improved clarity.  Flushed the redundant
%   checking for COMPILE flag on function type (EXPR, etc.). Changed to use
%   the existing PREFASLEVAL hook for special treatment of PUTD, DE, etc.,
%   instead of special case code.  Added the EVAL and IGNORE flag handling in
%   DFPRINTFASL (instead of DSKIN and TOPLOOP), for proper interaction with
%   macro expansion; macros can now expand into COMPILETIME, etc.  (Note
%   30-Apr-82 change, for amusement.)  Changed to use TOPLOOPEVAL* instead of
%   EVAL, for multiple dialect support.  Added warning message for non-list
%   form given to DFPRINTFASL.  Removed PACKAGE attribute from the file
%   header.
% 04-Jun-84 13:46:13 (Brian Beach)
%  Replaced compiletime dskin of SYSTEM-FASLOUT with compiletime load of
%  FASL-DECLS.  New constant model.  Replaced use of 2048 with constant
%  first-local-id-number.
% 12 Apr 1984 1411-PST (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Changed if_system unix to if_system vax and relative path load to shell
%  variable $pv.  Added hpux200 compiletime load.
% 28 Mar 1984 1702-PST (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Changed references to addressingunitsperitem from const to wconst.
%  Changed references to faslout-magic (previously FASL_MAGIC_NUMBER) from
%  const to wconst.
%  Moved (load monsym) to p20:system-faslout.sl where it belonged.
% 11-Jan-84 17:19:45 (Cris Perdue)
%  Modified codefiletrailer to accept a real string with a
%  header tag in its header word.  FASL file will always contain a
%  count for each string with no random extra bits set in that word.
% 06-Dec-83 10:00 (Brian Beach)
%   Translated from Rlisp to Lisp.
