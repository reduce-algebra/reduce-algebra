% This file portably fixes car and cdr of nil to be nil.  It should
% only be used when the target machine doesn't have a nice tricky way
% of handling car and cdr of nil (because this is expensive).  On the
% 68000's for example, it costs an additional 10 bytes for every car
% and cdr that is included (which is about an additional 75% in space).
% The time costs are very hard to measure, but probably are similar to
% the space costs.

% What we do is declare two fluid variables that as soon as the system
% sees them will allocate two new symbol table slots.  We initialize
% them to be nil.  They will be allocated sequentially, so, using the
% first one as the address, when the car to access them, it will
% get the value of the first and cdr will retrieve the value of the
% second.  This all pretty sleazy and is highly dependent on the
% underlying system.  For those of you who write code that doesn't
% rely on car and cdr of nil being nil, then you can use the fastcar
% flag.  The default of which is nil, which means it will do the check
% for nil.  When turned on, the system will revert back and generate
% the code as before.  So, if you want to use the car and cdr of nil
% style, then you must pay for it.

% The first two is where the car and cdr actually grab the values.
% The second is the flag to control if we check or not.

(fluid '(***MUST-BE-NIL*** ***MUST-BE-NIL-TOO*** *fastcar))

% Initialize each of the variables to nil.  The first two must not be
% changed (EVER!!).
(setf ***MUST-BE-NIL*** NIL)
(setf ***MUST-BE-NIL-TOO*** NIL)
(setf *fastcar nil)

% This little function is a way of testing to see if the *fastcar flag
% has been set or not.  Since I don't know of a way to put conditional
% code into the test part of the anyreg definition, this works
% reasonably well.
(de !&fastcar (u)
  *fastcar)

% Here are the anyregs.  There could be some optimization by checking
% for the argument type, except it might only save one instruction.
% Its all kind of a mess, since the field operation has to occur in a
% D register and the indexing has to occur in an A register.  The nil
% register is actually a D register, but comparisons work across
% register types.
