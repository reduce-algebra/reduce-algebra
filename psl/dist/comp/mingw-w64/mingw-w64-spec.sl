% This code is intended for filling the 'holes' in the frame.
% e.g. in the following function
%
%  (de hugo (x) (cond ((null x) (call-another))
%                     (t (prog (a b c) ....))
%
% a frame of length 4 will be allocated, but it will not be preset (by nil)
% completely at entering the function but the frame elements for a b and c
% will be set (to nil) if the prog is entered.
% So if the (null x) case is taken we have 3 unset frame elements on the stack
% which contain random information and this is dangerous for gc.
% to resolve that problem, the following function will work on the input
% to pass-1-lap and insert nil settings where needed.
