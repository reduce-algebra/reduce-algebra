% Revisions:
%
% 19 Mar 1988 (Julian Padget)
%  Added tag declaration for stack group descriptors.
% 17 Aug 1986 (Julian Padget)
%  Added tag declarations for bvectors, bstructs, contexts and funargs.
% 25 Jun 1986 (Leigh Stoller)
%  This file needs to be recompiled on the host machine when porting with the
%   tagbitlength set to target machine's value. It then must be loaded into
%   the cross compiler as the last module.
% 28 Mar 1984 1536-PST (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Fixed file name in header.
% 19 Dec 1983 1759-PST (Nancy Kendzierski)
%  Added header.
