% Double length multiply and divide for the  processor.
% These are the open codes which embed the extended arithmetic 
% operations such that they are accessible from compiled LISP top level.
% They map the 2*30 bit operations needed by BIG to the 2*32 bit operations
% of the processor by shifting etc.
